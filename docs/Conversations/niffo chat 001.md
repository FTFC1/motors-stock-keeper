this is the right way and they should pay us what we deserve for all of this hard work I'm not going to bring more continue already bro so basically the way this stuff works is you download dispatch register first the dispatch register does more than just keep the serial new dates in places more than just the reconciliation method for serial new details after you download the dispatch you download the serial new details you get which is all of your inventory yeah which is all the inventory we have now you pull up your excel files which is your reservation sheets basically now I take my dispatch register the reservation sheet is a excel file which is not generated from the erp it is generated manually by going through messages on the email on email or whatsapp about what is reserved however the dispatch register and the serial node they come from the erp which is locked we cannot connect to the erp via api so we still have to do an export yeah so I take the dispatch register and I go to my reservation sheet to go and check what or whose car has been delivered above the system you get so I use dispatch to take out the vehicles that were previously reserved after which I take the same dispatch to cross check because I do two different stocks the one I send to the group chat and the one I send to the executive management can you explain the difference between those two so the one I send to the group chat is only available stock okay only available stock what we have at hand that can be sold okay the one that we send to the executive management is what we have at hand what we have reserved and what we have cannibalized or in workshop can you explain what cannibalized and workshop is so there are some vehicles we that we have that we have that we have that we have that we have that we have that we have that the engine is faulty they can take side mirror from it and use to fix another car so that they can sell that car off so vehicles are cannibalized there's a warehouse for it cannibalized warehouse which you would find in serial node dates every single warehouse we have is on serial node dates yes yes my auto qc slash cannibalized yes so now once I take down my dispatch register and I use it to remove what was delivered from the executive stock and my reservation sheets then I go through my mails and my whatsapp to pick up reservations that were made overnight and I use it to pick up the other day and then I take it out of stock at hand which I send to the group just for the sales people so they know that it isn't available anymore okay let me give you an example like yesterday now Abuja branch requested for a cargo van passenger cargo van passenger 12 plus 2 seater that was the last one in stock I went to my reservation sheets I added it Abuja customer cargo van 12 plus 2 seater I went to stock for the sales people and I deleted that part from the stock report so yes you deleted it from the stock that sells people see yes but on zero no date that would still appear it would still appear on serial no dates because it hasn't been delivered off of erp yet right because reservations aren't on the erp yeah so reservation doesn't affect your erp data I see you get reservation is man made like it's manually generated because it is stock that is to be it hasn't been yet it's against the future who 90 percent of the time does reservations what type of person the oppressions the oppressions team basically not who um not who logs oh sorry like who makes reservation anybody can make a reservation anybody can make a reservation ah anybody can make you if you have a car that you want to sell to someone yeah you will send me the reservation sheet this is only if they're willing to pay at least 50 percent yes okay so if you have someone that wants to pay but they're not if you have someone that has 50 percent of the money you can come come and meet the sales admin and ask them to make a pfi for you once they make the pfi for you and he gets it signed just send a mail that a reservation should be made for the following vehicle for the following customer and you attach payment advice and you attach pfi to the mail okay so we could in a later time actually have a reservation form yeah you can have a reservation form and then you don't have to go through what's happened there so yeah then you just attach it as a file yeah all of the no no as in like customer name so if you if you're going to make that form yeah it would basically be a reservation yeah customer name yep customer address yep phone number vehicle interested in amount speed and then any upload and then column okay okay but they'd also have to upload the document now also after these these are the forms they would feel physically then at the bottom we would have kindly add like or drag and drop pfi and payment advice because payment advice and pfi are important so once this mail is sent or once this form is filled it goes both to operations team and accounts because accounts need to confirm the money paid okay and only once accounts have confirmed that once that 50 percent yes once accounts confirm the money in your accounts they send a mail back to you stating payment confirmed do you understand i understand i understand i'm just thinking to myself with the payment advice yeah the reservation can be made no i get that now accounts need to actually confirm the money is there but they can also for the vehicle to be delivered accounts can also use a phone or they could just basically accountants need to be like confirmed yes they can do that oh no they can do that i'm telling you the process we have on hand right now it's just it's without a form but the same thing yeah okay it's without the phone but it's the same thing basically once you once they send it must have sent in the mail it goes their ops and accounts kindly find attached payment advice and perform an invoice for social and social customer for social and then they go accounts kindly confirm payment of so some amounts was made ops kindly reserve color customer wants delivery to stay that is if it is full payments now you're saving everybody that back and forth stress with this form once they can click on this form they feel the customer's name address phone number color and vehicle they need and then they attach the necessary files all accounts need to do is click on confirmed and then they get the notification in their mail payments confirmed that way they are not stressing so you get some who do you want to be told that payments confirmed whoever sends oh right with the reservation yeah do you get that's what that's what like you know we've been looking for a way to that whoever sends for the reservation gets the notification yeah that saves everybody's stress of them always say ah accounts have not confirmed the money accounts have not confirmed the money okay okay okay okay and it saves account stress of replying emails because sometimes i can't to confirm the money but they will forget to reply your mail because they're actually busy crunching numbers so once this is sorted we take the details and put in the reservation sheets for the new day once the reservation sheet has been updated you take it out of actual stock do you get if it's a cs55 that the person wants like now let's say for example yesterday chiduke called me that i should help him reserve a cs55 luxury pro for a customer that he's in transit he can't send an email i said okay that's all well and good that's fine you still need to send an email i'll just take notes he said i beg help me take note because he doesn't want a situation whereby someone else will come now and buy everything in stock do you get hence why we need it real time if we add that up all he needs to do is start spelling the form and then if it's not complete the form will let him know that kindly attach what is left but like it would have already been notified that everybody will know that okay minus one suppose they something is spending now that is another work for another api that you'll be calling so okay let me just from my perspective say what i'm thinking so the first thing that came to mind is that you have a form that is somewhere maybe in the tool that we're building maybe in another space there's a form i have to sign in and fill out this form so that then it knows that i am the person who cares for when the payment is confirmed so i fill out this form for a reservation and i should i show proof of payment payment and i can't find it yeah and i'm and i add a pfi pfi or an invoice proof of payment invoice okay okay yeah so pfi and payment advice then accounts will have some kind of interface which will allow them bro the easiest way i feel like you can get me suited so they yeah then there's another place which is effectively admin view that is only for accounts to basically see the reservations that people need confirmed they will press confirm confirm confirm as and when they see it and then the notification will get sent to the requester of the reservation yes after that is done you then update your reservation list and remove that item from stock at hand now the thing that comes to my mind is the sensitivity of the information right because the current thing that we're building is like i guess it's kind of sensitive how many cards does meccano have it's not that bad but when we now starting to upload someone's address how much they paid do you see what i mean i can imagine them being like nah you're not microsoft doing it on email no do you get my thoughts which is why i said that security and they can't really remove that email but also like if they're doing that that's going to make the app more bold i mean okay so i'm pretty sure that microsoft business suite will have its for its own version of google forms yeah definitely they'll have notifications which will have and then those forms will if they as long as they allow i mean there are there are platforms perhaps for example i can't make the form right i have to use a form builder that has more security built in and then i'm just building on top of it so maybe it's not that far now notes in this same form there would be an extra spot for them to be able to let accounts know if someone is paying on behalf of the customer if not accounts will have to request for them to get a letter from the customer because that happens now so in the mail now if someone is paying on behalf of let's say i'm paying on behalf of you in the mail as long as the salesperson sees you from the beginning that nifem is paying on behalf of ft that's fine accounts reply that what name should it be created in or if you if there's a specific request that it shouldn't be in my name so there will be add remarks in this form so aside from attachments and the details there needs there needs to be a spot for them to add remarks do you get because bulk of the time people come and buy cards for themselves but they use their company account to pay so the person has to state it from the beginning if not accounts who have back and forth trouble logging it and whatnot how how often is this like how how critical of problem is this whole reservation because we're where what we've done without reservation yeah your stock will never be accurate yes because croquis what's if you come and meet me now and tell me that i want to buy cs55 you've paid and everything and i say okay that's come and then we deliver for you and then i forget and i deliver for you again because oh right because you reserved because i got the reserved vehicle and then i said if i say that oh i didn't get the vehicle and then you give it to me from the normal stock on hand yeah so now if this that is one way another way is without this reservation how would i know what it is that i'm supposed to take out of stock at hand okay but but but the simplest thing right if we just because obviously there's varying levels of complexity here the simplest thing to do would be to have an admin view in the inventory which is effectively you just doing the same thing that you're doing in your manual reservation sheet and you're just so you have 250 vehicles in total you can you pick the brand you search the model you find the model the trim the color and you know that you have five gray hunter plus and then you mark two as reserved that's that done yeah and then from there we can build it i'm just trying to think about what because otherwise it's like yeah that's not going to practice this is what we had said before like doing the reservation for it to reflect isn't the problem is the documentation of the reservation now you take those two hours what do you know you reserved to school how do you want to remember the customer name and all of those things okay who is it for where is the pfi do you get who is it for where is it going how much did they pay what color do they want the color you know yeah the color you know okay yeah so okay again at a very very basic level when you mark something that's reserved obviously you're marking a single unit or multiple units as reserved you mark as reserved you'll go you would have to make the person so yourself for example to put in information so you click reserved and then you say who how much and then the rest of the service basically also location of the vehicle yeah we're doing that separately already no not of the vehicle location of where the reservation is coming from let me give you an instance most bank deals comes from the vi branch which is like additional so on our reservation sheets it goes the customer name the branch if it is here or if it's any sales person under us here even the guys at each other we write models okay followed by the dates the reservation was made okay so reservation is in an associated branch okay that's fine you know right the customer name thank dollar coca models 5th of march 2025 brand shangani model x7 plus color dark gray do you get now that one sorted that's the first few columns on the reservation sheet that's how it goes yeah that's the most basic form of a reservation yeah that's that's like the first few forms yeah every other thing that follows is amount paid total amount of the vehicle proof of payment no you don't put all of those like like now if the vehicle is 50 million and you pay 25 million i would write pfi amount 15 million amount paid 25 million um salesperson fz remarks reserved part paid now for bank deals it goes reserved lpu they still pay the lp is still free they still create lpa no no nothing goes as credit okay another thing that you would see is management management if it's management management you don't ask questions they would follow up for their money by themselves but it's management management so for reservation sheet as much as we want to make it easy we also have to leave the manual one based off the fact that we still send reservation to upper management so they know what it is people are buying the most of and they can use to order right now they just place order for 80 x7s because they realize that x7 is what is moving the most of the passenger cars followed by let me see 55 they know that x7 55 is moving because they are looking at what car is reserved the most or what car is selling the most so if the cars are reserved that means that's the car that is selling the most the most amount of cars you'll find on europe but they're two different things they are they are but like if i sell a car maybe i didn't just phrase it well so if you're selling x7 i think i basically get if i sell a car it's on sales report in one place if i reserve a cart on reservation yeah but before it gets to the sales reports it would always be on the reservation sheets every sold car passes through the reservation yes even if i come and pay in full it still goes on reservation okay if you're coming if you're walking in and you're paying in full and you want to take your car as you're leaving it doesn't come on reservation sheets now which is where you use dispatch register the next day because it must be invoiced and it must reflect on the erp and then you would see what car it was and then you take it out of main stock we are we are never getting an agency to like this is so complicated do you have to do it like we're gonna do it but this is this this thing we're talking about happens every day abuja delivers a car of the system yes we don't know what abuja's reservation sheet looks like we just see it on this petrol this side up this vehicle was delivered by the time you go and check the branch the reason why this is the thing is because not all of the branches comply with these rules abuja branch for example you never see their pfis it's essentially a mystery as to which and who the car has been sold to until the invoice arrives and even then someone can be buying half of another car and therefore you won't know who the cars are going to the car is a cabal on its own but abuja will still look at what you post which is the current stock i post to all the branches every day so there is the main group where everybody here sees the reservation then there's another group chat whereby is for all the branch managers okay and like all the top guys of all the the micano whatever cube 65 guys the royal box guys the cube 65 guys royal box guys all of them so i posted it there so everybody sees what is on stock every day and when they are not sure what is on stock they put a call out but with this it should be easier for them because all they need to do is click on the app and then they see okay there's still 15 and if they need to make a reservation all they need to do is reserve how many do you need to reserve i think the easiest way here for now for now it isn't the best way it's not the best way the easiest is that you need to do is to save without details on the app and then send your mail with the details that way it saves it saves the back and forth of ah you're leaking people's vital information and what reserve on the app if you want 15 x7 from the 80 x7 click 15 branch abuja very excellent plus color you get they can do the basic things on the app but when it comes to the details on the pfi the same via mail okay and when it comes to abuja we know we won't receive the email for said reservation on our own but we still okay so that that sometimes whereby abuja sends us email that to reserve 25 zlas for us and send to our pfi all we go to do is reservation sheet open abuja customer branch abuja and then for the remarks we don't even put anything in the amount because we don't know whatever it is how much is being sold for whatever and we go to the remarks and we write management management jiggas so that's basically how it works for abuja so okay that way it will be even be easier to track that way i feel like it will be easier to track it will be easier to track what it is that abuja have reserved because abuja have their own reservation sheet yeah which they collect the same way we do our they do the same thing there but they do it for only abuja branch we do for ibadan but i thought if potakot needed reservations today and they want to sell right you said that abuja does what abuja is the only branch that has their own reservation list they don't ask you to reserve maybe when they feel like but then how how do they know how much stock there is they always know how much stock they receive stock every day and they then deduct themselves their own reservation yeah okay there's nothing we can do about that so they have their own reservation unless unless siam now says can you send your own reservation sheets let's match up with ours so that we know what it is yeah but right now what they do is hello siam then siam tells us make so so and so reservation siam is the head of operations lagos for lagos because mr fadi is head of operations oh fadi sam1 is head of operations okay from abuja jiket so i think even siam as siam is the head here mr fadi is still above okay i guess i'm not sure how the hierarchy works you get me so accept that and sometimes if they want if they don't check the stock report that i said they call siam how many of these vehicles do we have in stock which colors okay siam tells them okay reserve 40 for us siam says ah oh she can get up to 40 other sales people to have made reservations or not i think that's what siam is also trying to get down okay so get down so that it reduces how much it feels like someone is using that to power over the others because sales people here might want to sell a car and then they'll come and they'll hear it's fully booked yeah that there's nothing available again okay but with the app it's happening in real time yes everyone can see this is what's reserved they can't see what's reserved they sell people can just see what's available but admin we know what's in yourself yeah it doesn't consent sales people was reserved it's just we are the back end we in the operations so we know what it is that we are calling the customers and what to deliver do you understand so all the sales people really need to see you at the end of the day yeah for sales people they need available yeah yeah uh-huh but i don't know what's wrong with this pairing on yes so sales so sales what they need is available stock at hand slash incoming stock which they gets currently they get incoming as well yeah if you open today's stock that i said you'll see pre-sale somewhere at one side and then you see stock on the other side we tell we tell them what's coming yes so they can plan so they can sell reservations yes i see okay so we call it pre-sale for them so they can get pre-sale down yeah so they see this they i mean it's good it's it's good for them so that they can plan ahead now that's what they need two what they would need is a reservation sheet to be able to you mean the form reservation the form from the phone i don't yeah because you don't show them yes form they need the form yeah to be able to feel and update us in real time do you get yeah and that will need an approval from accounts no they approve the the confirmation is from account but you okay let me what's what's going to approve you and what admins will approve because otherwise a salesperson can reserve because we're reserving without oh no yes yes yes no so when they send the form yeah they're not it's not going to go out of stock then they're just filling the form and sending it to us we are the ones decide to actually mark these items as reserved yes and that is where you what you will do is you will see the form request you will wait or you will receive the details by email and then you'll confirm with accounts the money yeah and only then will you say money is here therefore i can mark it as reserve on the no no no you're going to confuse each other like that instead of like once they so then they have no power yes these two are basically what they need the most yes available stock hand and incoming stock for sale yeah do you get like like now let me see x7 we have no x7 in store on the dashboard it will show x7 by the side it will show pre-sale giga in like a small gray button and then we'll show how many are coming if you're making a reservation from that even that would still change what do you mean it will still change like if you send me a reservation for 2x7 and we have hc coming um by the time you fill your form and do everything i'll take it out of it you say it should be 78 left but so what i'm asking you is will you take it out before you have the payment confirmation payment advice as already no if i don't see payment advice yeah i can't take it out so yeah okay we're saying if i see payment advice yeah i can take it out yeah while accounts confirm yes so yeah so i'm a salesperson i fill out the reservation form and i email to you the private information yeah you will then confirm that this money has been received by accounts yeah no it's not even my own confirmation the person is the sales people that need to confirm because if they don't if their money is not confirmed they're the ones that need to chase okay so we need the we need the confirmation as well don't get me wrong it's not like we don't okay so the salesperson will fill out the form will send an email to the accounts accounts will confirm it to the salesperson at that point the salesperson will find an admin and tell that and show the admin here proof no no that's long yeah just cc ups yeah cc and admin admin will then mark his reserve yeah when they're sending the email to account cc us just cc us in the mail okay okay because the pfi is also needed by accounts to create the accounts the customer account on our system okay so now you've you're a salesperson you want to sell cs15 to let's say mtn you'll come on you'll come to you come to the app you fill your phone after you see that it's available and then you come you fill your form you put all the details you go to your email kindly find attached payment advice and pro forma invoice for said customer accounts kindly confirm amounts cc ups so whenever accounts are replying we would have seen the reply so we know the money has been confirmed take for example saturday that we're looking for high-techs money that i was running up and that i was me ucm we realized that high-tech didn't pay the money into me cano motors they paid it into me cano medical which is why you need accounts to confirm before you go and deliver yes that the money has actually hit our own account if not sometimes the money can bounce back okay okay do you get so i don't know it doesn't we're not building anything for accounts no all accounts are getting is email notification yeah okay okay do you get so we don't even need to but i don't know because if you start adding an extra app for accounts they can shoot us let them just get email notification and they'll get me they can get since they're attaching it on the phone the form is sending straight to accounts because accounts as a group has an email yeah ops as a group has an email that's all it goes to accounts and it goes to ups you got to accounts ups and pdi itself let's even just make easy so pdi can prepare the vehicle down because so accounts ups and pdi those are the only three that need the email and then confirmation wait pb you know what i said pdi pdi needs to be in the loop from the beginning so that they know that they can make because they have their own reservation as well okay on their own end which is called a master file where they have a list of all the vehicles we have and then that's just inventory yes the inventory is super they call it like the master file but they write each customer's name they're the ones that assign cars okay to customers they are actually doing the last month or last step which is this vin to this customer you know these vins to this customer yeah so now in in the process whereby they're going through or they're preparing a vehicle for this said customer let's say the mtn that we spoke about and then you realize that they have faults on the car they would be the ones to still change the vin not us here do you get but now the reason why we don't give account and we don't give the sales people vin and engine number is due until the vehicle has been invoiced and the money has been confirmed in case the vin changes why would the vin change anything can happen okay like it gets it gets that car now is part of a bigger deal and therefore oh no probably kind of alive there's a crack on the windscore somewhere or something you get yeah so those those are the things that's change so all out of all of these three all i'm all i can tell you for a fact is the three people that i know that will receive mail notifications accounts of some pdi now accounts are not replying the app accounts are just going to reply straight back to the mail cc in ops then they're going to still continue about the with the video they work they'll just reply okay money has been confirmed yeah okay that's basically it yeah
