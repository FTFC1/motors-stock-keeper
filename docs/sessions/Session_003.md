# Session 003 - High Priority Requirements Implementation

Date: March 5, 2025

## Overview
This session focuses on implementing the high-priority requirements identified in the vehicle inventory requirements document, with consideration for MCP integration. We'll be tackling these in order of implementation priority:

1. Brand-Level Dashboard Organization (Highest Priority - Lowest Complexity)
2. Unit Location Tracking
3. Role-Based View Restrictions (Will require MCP/Supabase setup)

## Goals for This Session

1. **Brand-Level Dashboard Organization**
   - Restructure dashboard to group vehicles by brand first (before model/trim)
     - Show brands as major sections/cards with collapsible details
     - Include count of total vehicles per brand for quick reference
   - Sort brands by total stock amount (brands with more inventory appear first)
   - Add selective filtering for:
     - Wheel Drive (4x4, 4x2) across all brands
     - Transmission Type (Auto, Manual) across all brands
   - Ensure mobile-friendly layout for brand grouping
     - Collapsible sections for each brand
     - Touch-friendly expanding/collapsing

2. **Unit Location Tracking**
   - Update vehicle unit data structure to include warehouse location field
     - Add a `location` field to the `VehicleUnit` type
     - Location will be a string matching one of the 31 warehouse names
   - Status clarity:
     - Current: Vehicle status is a single field at the vehicle level
     - Change to: Status at the unit level with simplified options
     - New options: "Available", "In Transit", "Display", "Unavailable"
     - Note: Port shipments are marked as "In Transit"
   - Create warehouse selection interface in unit forms
     - Implement searchable dropdown with 31 predefined warehouse options
     - Include warehouse grouping by region if possible
     - Ensure mobile-friendly input method
   - Add location-based filtering to vehicle lists
     - Filter by specific warehouse or warehouse group
     - Combined filtering with other vehicle attributes

3. **MCP Setup and Role-Based Restrictions**
   - Set up Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) integration
     - Create connection to MCP endpoint (using link provided: mcp.composio.dev)
     - Set up initial data models for vehicles, units, locations
     - Test basic CRUD operations through MCP
   - Define role types (Admin, Sales, Operations)
     - Admin: Full access to all functions and data
     - Sales: View only Available and In Transit units
     - Operations: Full inventory management access
   - Implement view restrictions for sales staff
     - Filter UI components based on user role
     - Restrict data access patterns
   - Create admin interface for role management
     - Add/remove users
     - Assign roles

## Starting State
### Current Features
- Unit-based vehicle data structure implemented
- Mock data system in place
- Basic dashboard functionality
- Vehicle grouping and filtering

### Tech Debt/Issues to Consider
- Need to add selectable warehouse locations (using names from warehouses.md)
- Current dashboard needs restructuring for brand-first view instead of model-first
- MCP setup required (using provided link: mcp.composio.dev/supabase/best-tinkling-easter-OjKZ3n)
- Need to maintain compatibility with future potential Supabase direct migration

   - Add drive type and transmission filters as top-level filters
     - Create filter UI components that apply across all brands
     - Update filtering logic to handle these attributes
   - Optimize mobile view with touch-friendly controls

2. **Phase 2: Location Integration (2-3 days)**
   - Update VehicleUnit type to include location field
     - Add types and validation
     - Update mock data generator
   - Implement warehouse selection UI
     - Create searchable dropdown component for 31 warehouse options
     - Add to unit creation/edit forms
   - Update status handling
     - Simplify to four status options
     - Update UI to reflect status changes
   - Add location-based filtering
     - Add location filters to dashboard
     - Update filtering logic

3. **Phase 3: MCP Setup (3-4 days)**
   - Set up MCP connection using provided link
     - Create necessary models and types
     - Set up authentication patterns
   - Implement role-based data access
     - Create role definitions
     - Add role-based filtering logic
   - Build role management UI for admins
     - Create user management screens
     - Add role assignment functionality

## Progress Update

### Completed: Brand-Level Dashboard Organization

We've successfully implemented the brand-first dashboard organization with several UX improvements:

1. **Brand-First Hierarchy**
   - Created a new BrandCard component that organizes vehicles by brand
   - Implemented collapsible cards for each brand with entire header clickable
   - Made brands sortable by total inventory count (most inventory first)
   - Added visual enhancements like shadow effects and hover states

2. **Enhanced Vehicle Information**
   - Added wheel drive types (4x4, 4x2, etc.) with appropriate icons
   - Added transmission types (Auto, Manual) with intuitive visual indicators
   - Improved the layout of vehicle specs for better readability
   - Added left border accent to vehicle cards for better visual hierarchy

3. **Improved Filtering Capabilities**
   - Added filters for wheel drive and transmission type
   - Fixed critical bug where clicking filters caused blank screen
   - Enhanced filter state management and validation
   - Added better empty state messaging based on filter context

4. **Mobile Experience Optimization**
   - Made all brand cards collapsible with large touch targets
   - Improved spacing and layout for mobile viewports
   - Enhanced visual feedback for interactive elements
   - Ensured consistent spacing and alignment across devices

### Next Steps

1. **Unit Location Tracking**
   - Begin implementing the warehouse location field in the VehicleUnit type
   - Create the warehouse selection interface
   - Update the mock data generator to include location information

## Success Criteria
- Dashboard clearly groups vehicles by brand with proper stock-based sorting
- All 31 warehouses are available as options in a searchable dropdown
- Status system correctly handles the four simplified status options
- System performs well with expected data volumes
- Mobile interface remains usable with the brand-first grouping
- MCP successfully integrates for basic operations

## Technical Dependencies
- MCP integration for database operations (see [supabase_thoughts.md](../supabase_thoughts.md))
- MCP connection at: mcp.composio.dev/supabase/best-tinkling-easter-OjKZ3n
- Warehouse location names from [warehouses.md](../warehouses.md)
- Vehicle inventory requirements from [vehicle_inventory_requirements.md](../vehicle_inventory_requirements.md)

## Notes
- Port locations are considered part of "In Transit" status
- Customer delivery tracking is not in scope
- Sales status tracking is not in scope (focus on location and availability only)
- With only ~5 brands total, brand filtering itself is less critical than other filters
- Mobile-friendly interfaces are essential for warehouse staff
