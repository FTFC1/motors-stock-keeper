# Motors Stock Manager App Flow Document

## Introduction

This document explains how the Motors Stock Manager works, providing a full picture of every key page and user journey. The system is an internal tool designed for automotive company staff who need to manage vehicle inventory, update stock levels, and handle administrative tasks in one centralized location. The main goal is to offer a secure, data-driven interface for both administrative users and sales staff. This is achieved by using role-based access control, a real-time data update system, and a design that is both mobile-friendly and optimized for dark mode. The user experience has been planned carefully, starting from secure login to performing specific actions in a clear and uncomplicated manner.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user comes to the system, they are first greeted by a landing page that highlights the key features of Motors Stock Manager. The user can then choose to create an account if they are a new staff member, though in many internal systems the account creation can be handled centrally. For sign-up, users are asked to enter their work email and a secure password. Email domain restrictions are in place to ensure that only authorized employees can register. After a successful registration, or if the user already has an account, they proceed to a straightforward sign-in page where they enter their credentials. If a user forgets their password, a simple recovery option is available where they can initiate a password reset process by providing their registered email, and instructions are sent to help them restore access. The sign-in and sign-up flows are easy to follow, ensuring that staff members quickly gain access and begin using the dashboard.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon signing in, users arrive at the main dashboard, which serves as the central hub of the application. The landing page immediately presents a clean and data-focused layout. In the header, there are options for navigation, including access to settings, notifications, and logout. A sidebar or a top navigation bar allows users to move between different modules such as stock management, pending edits, and change logs. The content area displays a detailed table of vehicle inventory data that is dynamic and updates in real time. The interface adjusts based on whether the logged-in user is an Admin or Sales Staff. Admin users see additional tools for modifying stock, performing bulk updates, and reviewing pending changes, while Sales Staff see a simplified version that focuses on filtering, sorting, and viewing stock availability without making any modifications.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

After the login process, the user’s role determines their journey within the application. For Admin users, the journey begins on a dashboard that displays a comprehensive table of vehicle inventory. Here, the user has the ability to click on individual vehicle entries to open a detailed view where they can adjust stock levels. When bulk updates are needed, the Admin can select several entries by simply clicking on rows within the table. This selection navigates to a bulk update page where the user can enter new data for several entries simultaneously. Before finalizing the changes, a bulk update preview screen is displayed. On this screen, all pending changes are clearly summarized so that the Admin can manually approve or discard each modification. Later on, an area is dedicated to Pending Edits where the system shows a badge with the number of unsaved updates. This section is closely integrated with a Change Log that captures all updates with clear timestamps and the names of the administrators who made the changes. For Sales Staff, the flow after login leads to an interface optimized for data viewing. They are not given options to modify the records. Instead, their view is focused on extensive filtering options to search by brand, model, trim, or fuel type, and a sorting feature which organizes data by criteria such as alphabetical order or stock quantity. Navigation between these pages is streamlined by clear buttons and labels, ensuring that all pages are connected and that the user can always return to the main dashboard with ease.

## Settings and Account Management

Once a user is inside the dashboard, they have access to a user settings area where they can manage their personal information. This includes options to update their password, change contact details, and set personal preferences such as switching between light and dark mode. The settings page is accessible from a clear and simple menu in the header or sidebar, ensuring that users can make adjustments without disrupting their workflow. In addition to personal settings, there is a section where users can manage notification settings and review account activity. For users who need to update subscription or access rights, especially in an internal use case like this one, the corresponding sections are clearly marked. After making changes, users can effortlessly return to the main dashboard to continue their tasks without any extra steps.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The application has been built to handle errors and alternate flows gracefully. If a user enters incorrect login information, clear error messages appear, prompting them to try again or use the forgot password option. When invalid data is entered during stock updates or bulk edits, the system immediately highlights the error with notification banners that explain the issue in simple language. In case of a lost connection or data synchronization error, the interface displays a banner alert and automatically attempts to refresh the session once connectivity is re-established. When an update is made, a small notification banner provides immediate feedback along with an undo option that is available for 5-10 seconds. If the user misses this window, the change becomes final and further manual edits are required. These safeguards ensure that even when errors occur, the user is never left confused, and the system always guides them back into a normal flow.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the moment a staff member accesses the application via a landing page, they experience a well-organized and secure workflow. The journey begins with a simple sign-up or login process that strictly enforces company domain restrictions. Depending on whether the user is an Admin or Sales Staff, they are directed to an interface that enhances their specific needs, whether it is in-depth inventory management and editing for Admin users or a detailed, filterable view for Sales Staff. Every action from bulk updates and real-time data synchronization to error handling and undo capabilities has been thoughtfully integrated into the overall design. The system’s ease of navigation, combined with clear notification and settings options, ensures that internal staff can manage vehicle inventory with confidence, clarity, and efficiency.
