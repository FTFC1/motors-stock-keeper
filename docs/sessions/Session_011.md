# Session 011: Authentication Stability, Database Optimization and Component Documentation

## Date: March 20, 2025

## Overview
We've hit a major milestone in stabilising our authentication system and setting up clear documentation patterns. This session bridges the gap between theoretical plans and practical implementation, particularly in how our auth and database systems work together. We're now much closer to a rock-solid Version 1 release.

## Achievements

### üîê Authentication Stability
- Fixed JWT token refresh issues with proper expiry handling
- Prevented duplicate profile creation through RLS policies
- Solved session persistence across page reloads using localStorage fallback
- Created practical integration guide with auth hook examples

### üöÄ Performance Optimization
- Streamlined vehicle queries for faster loading using optimised SQL joins
- Set up connection pooling to reduce database load with PgBouncer
- Added proper loading states across all operations with Suspense boundaries
- Created reusable data fetching patterns with SWR cache invalidation

### üìö Documentation System
- Launched component documentation system with MDX
- Documented BrandCard as first example with full prop interfaces
- Created templates for future components with TypeScript generics
- Set up cross-referencing between docs using custom linking system

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Authentication Timeouts
**Problem**: Users getting logged out unexpectedly due to JWT expiry and refresh token failures
**Solution**: Implemented smart token refresh with backup options using a sliding window approach and secure HttpOnly cookies
**Learning**: Always build auth systems with retry mechanisms and fallback authentication paths

### 2. Slow Loading States
**Problem**: UI feeling sluggish and inconsistent due to waterfall data fetching
**Solution**: Created standardized loading patterns with skeleton loaders and data prefetching
**Learning**: Define loading states before building features and use React Suspense boundaries consistently

### 3. Complex Data Queries
**Problem**: Database queries taking too long due to non-optimised table relationships
**Solution**: Optimized selection patterns and added proper indexes on frequently queried columns
**Learning**: Plan data structure with querying patterns in mind and set up pg_stat_statements for query analysis

## Path to Version 1 (Target: April 2nd)

### This Week (March 20-24)
- [ ] Complete core component docs
- [ ] Test all auth edge cases
- [ ] Fix remaining UI glitches
- [ ] Add logging for auth issues

### Next Week (March 25-April 1)
- [ ] Implement pagination
- [ ] Polish animations
- [ ] Run comprehensive tests
- [ ] Prepare deployment scripts

## Next Actions

### üé® Documentation
- [ ] Document DetailedBrandCard - March 22
- [ ] Document InventorySheet - March 22
- [ ] Document GroupedVehicleCard - March 23
- [ ] Document ColorTabs - March 23

### üîç Testing
- [ ] Run auth stress tests - March 21
- [ ] Test multi-user scenarios - March 22
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness - March 23

## Conclusion
- **Key Wins**: Stable auth system, optimized queries, clear documentation path
- **Overlooked Gem**: The custom hook pattern for data fetching that significantly reduced boilerplate
- **Next Focus**: Comprehensive testing and final UI polish

## Technicals Explained

### JWT Authentication Flow
- Implemented a dual-token system (access + refresh) with secure cookie storage
- Access tokens valid for 15 minutes, refresh tokens for 7 days
- Silent refresh happens 1 minute before access token expiry
- Fallback mechanism uses localStorage but with encrypted token data

### Database Query Optimization
- Added composite indexes on (vehicle_id, brand_id) for faster joins
- Implemented connection pooling with 10 min idle timeout
- Added prepared statements for common queries to reduce parsing overhead
- Query caching layer with 5-minute TTL for read-heavy operations
