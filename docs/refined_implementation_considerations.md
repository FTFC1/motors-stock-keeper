# Refined Implementation Considerations
*Date: March 4, 2025*

This document refines our implementation approach based on feedback from the Operations Manager regarding edge cases and business rules. It focuses on practical considerations relevant to the company's specific operational context.

## 1. Unit Location Tracking

**Critical Considerations:**
- **Location Management:** System must allow administrators to add new locations and handle location closures
- **Simple Location Flow:** Standard flow is Port → Warehouse → Customer; no need for complex transit tracking
- **Location Types Needed:**
  - Dealership locations
  - Warehouse
  - PDI (Pre-Delivery Inspection)
  - Repairs/Workshop (for damaged units)
  - Port (initial arrival point)

**Not Needed:**
- Tracking for exhibitions, test drive events, or temporary locations (typically 3-5 days maximum)
- Third-party storage facilities
- Direct transit-to-customer tracking (always goes through warehouse first)

## 2. Color Management

**Critical Considerations:**
- **Admin-Controlled:** Colors should be managed by admin users only
- **Searchable Dropdown:** Implement with ability to add new colors when needed
- **Color Deletion:** Admin should have the option to delete colors (with confirmation dialog)
- **Color Volume:** Typically maximum of 6 colors per model, so no need for complex pagination

**Not Needed:**
- International color naming (English only)
- Custom wraps or repaints (considered after-sales)
- Manufacturer color code management
- Complex color merging functionality

## 3. Inventory Segmentation Limits

**Critical Considerations:**
- **Performance Optimization:** Design for efficient handling of reasonable data volumes
- **Usable Interface:** Ensure the interface remains clear and usable even with all available colors (max ~6 per model)

**Not Needed (for now):**
- Special handling for limited connectivity
- Advanced accessibility features
- Saved filter states
- Mixed segmentation views
- Print/export optimizations

## 4. Brand-Level Dashboard Organization

**Critical Considerations:**
- **Simple Brand Structure:** Focus on Brand → Model → Trim → Color organization
- **Brand Sorting:** Order brands by stock amount for relevance
- **Limited Scale:** System needs to handle less than 10 brands total
- **Additional Attributes:** Include Wheel Drive (4x4, 4x2) and Transmission Type (Auto, Manual) as filterable attributes

**Not Needed:**
- Sub-brand hierarchies
- Dealer-specific brand filtering
- Rebadged vehicle handling (no vehicles sold under different brands)

**For Brand Changes:**
- Brand changes (like acquisitions) would be handled at the brand level through admin editing

## 5. Role-Based View Restrictions

**Critical Considerations:**
- **Highest Role Priority:** Users with multiple roles should have permissions of highest role
- **Clear Boundaries:** National sales managers should not have stock-changing abilities (reserved for operations)
- **Admin Assistance:** Sales staff should ask admins when they need information about reserved vehicles

**Not Needed:**
- Complex training mode (will use demo videos instead)
- Emergency overrides (handled by asking admin)
- Complex mid-session role updates (sales roles are mostly view-only)

## 6. Pre-Sold Transit Units Management

**Critical Considerations:**
- **Status Changes:** Canceled pre-orders should change from "pre-sold" to "pre-inventory" (subset of in-transit)
- **Damage Handling:** Damaged units should be marked as "unavailable" with location set to PDI or repairs/workshop
- **Batch Arrivals:** Need to handle partial fulfillment of batches (some units arrive while others don't)
- **Unit Substitution:** Process for when customers accept different model/color than originally ordered

**Not Needed:**
- Deposit status tracking
- Delivery date management
- Order swapping between dealers
- Complex specification change tracking

## Implementation Priorities

Based on this refined understanding, we recommend the following implementation priorities:

**Phase 1 (High Priority):**
1. Unit location tracking with admin-managed locations
2. Brand-level dashboard organization
3. Role-based view restrictions

**Phase 2 (Medium Priority):**
1. Color management with searchable dropdown
2. Pre-sold transit unit status handling

**Phase 3 (Lower Priority):**
1. Interface optimizations for color segmentation
2. Additional refinements based on user feedback

## Technical Approach

The implementation should follow these principles:

1. **Simplicity First:** Focus on core functionality before adding complexity
2. **Admin Control:** Provide robust tools for administrators to manage system data
3. **Clear Status Flow:** Design intuitive status transitions that match business processes
4. **Flexible Foundation:** Build with ability to add more sophisticated features later
5. **Mobile Optimization:** Ensure all features work well on mobile devices used by sales team
