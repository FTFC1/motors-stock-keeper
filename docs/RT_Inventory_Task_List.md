## Notes on Priority

1. **Focus on core inventory first** - Get the basic add/edit flows working perfectly
2. **Add reservation system second** - Build on top of the stable inventory base
3. **Enhance as needed** - Add other features based on user feedback
4. **Documentation evolves with code** - Update docs as features are implemented

This list intentionally consolidates all tasks from various documents into a single trackable reference. Other documentation will be updated as features are completed.
