# Sessions Format Guide

## Purpose
This guide outlines our session documentation structure. Good documentation helps track progress and maintain clarity on our development journey.

## File Structure
- Location: `/docs/sessions/`
- Naming: `Session_XXX.md` (e.g., Session_001.md)

## Session Flow

### 1. Title and Date
```markdown
# Session XXX: [Descriptive Title]
[YYYY-MM-DD]
```

### 2. Challenges Review
Start by identifying what needs solving:

```markdown
## Current Challenges

### 1. [Challenge Name]
**Problem**: Technical description of the issue
**Impact**: How it affects users/system
**Proposed Solution**: Initial thoughts on resolution
```

### 3. Solutions and Implementation
Document how we're tackling each challenge:

```markdown
## Solutions Implementation

### 1. [Challenge Name]
**Approach**: Technical implementation details
**Changes**: Specific code/system changes
**Learning**: Key insights gained
```

### 4. Path to Version X
Map out the implementation timeline:

```markdown
## Path to Version X (Target: [Date])

### This Week
- [ ] High-priority tasks
- [ ] Critical fixes

### Next Week
- [ ] Upcoming features
- [ ] Planned improvements
```

### 5. Documentation Updates
Track what needs documenting:

```markdown
## Documentation Tasks
- [ ] Update component docs
- [ ] Add implementation details
- [ ] Update API references
```

### 6. Testing Requirements
```markdown
## Testing Coverage
- [ ] Unit tests for new features
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
```

### 7. Technical Details
When needed, include implementation specifics:

```markdown
## Technical Implementation
- Architecture decisions
- Performance considerations
- Security measures
```

### 8. Session Achievements
End with what was accomplished:

```markdown
## Achievements
- Completed tasks
- Resolved issues
- Progress metrics
```

## Best Practices
1. **Start with Problems**: Always begin by clearly stating challenges
2. **Document as You Go**: Update during the session, not after
3. **Be Specific**: Include technical details and metrics
4. **Link Everything**: Reference related docs and PRs
5. **Track Progress**: Use checkboxes for actionable items
6. **Include Code**: Add relevant code snippets
7. **Add Screenshots**: Visual progress is important

Remember: Sessions are live documents that evolve as we work through problems! ðŸš€
