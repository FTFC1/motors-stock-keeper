# Session 001 - Project Setup and Initial UI Improvements

## Date: March 3, 2024

### Project Overview
We're working on the Motors Stock Manager, a web-based dashboard for automotive company staff to manage vehicle inventory. The project was initially set up using Lovable but due to edit credit limitations, we decided to continue development using Cursor IDE.

### Current Project State
The project is set up with:
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Shadcn/ui components
- React Router for navigation
- React Query for data management
- Mock authentication system (to be replaced with Supabase)

### Branch Information
- Working on branch: `cursor_002`
- Forked from Lovable's initial setup
- GitHub Repository: [motors-stock-keeper](https://github.com/FTFC1/motors-stock-keeper)

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Project Analysis
- Reviewed existing documentation
- Identified key features and requirements
- Assessed current codebase structure and dependencies

#### 2. UI Improvements
- Added collapsible sidebar functionality for desktop view
  - Toggle button for collapse/expand
  - Smooth transition animations
  - Tooltips for collapsed state
  - Maintained mobile responsiveness
  - Commit: `97122bc`

### Next Steps (Pending)
1. Integrate Supabase
   - Set up authentication
   - Implement real-time database functionality
   - Replace mock data with actual database operations

2. Implement Core Features
   - Vehicle management UI
   - Bulk update functionality
   - Change log system
   - Pending edits workflow

3. Enhance User Experience
   - Add loading states
   - Implement error handling
   - Add undo functionality for changes

### Tech Decisions Made
1. Continue with the existing tech stack from Lovable's setup
2. Plan to integrate Supabase for backend functionality
3. Keep the mobile-first approach with responsive design
4. Use shadcn/ui components for consistent UI

### Notes
- The project has good documentation in the `/docs` directory
- Current implementation uses mock data that needs to be replaced with real database operations
- Authentication system needs to be replaced with Supabase auth

### Questions to Address
1. Supabase project setup and credentials
2. Specific requirements for the bulk update preview interface
3. Detailed requirements for the change log system
