# Session 001 - Project Setup and Initial Development

Date: March 3, 2024

## Overview
This session focused on transitioning the Motors Stock Manager project from Lovable to Cursor development environment and implementing initial UI improvements.

## Project State Assessment
### Current Setup
- Project is based on a React + TypeScript + Vite template
- Using shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for styling
- Basic routing and authentication structure in place
- Mock data implementation for vehicle management

### Tech Stack
- Frontend Framework: React 18 with TypeScript
- Build Tool: Vite
- UI Components: shadcn/ui (based on Radix UI)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Routing: React Router
- State Management: React Query
- Form Handling: React Hook Form
- Validation: Zod

## Decisions Made
1. **Development Environment**
   - Decided to move from Lovable to Cursor due to edit credit limitations
   - Created and switched to `cursor_002` branch for development
   - Maintained existing project structure and dependencies

2. **UI Improvements**
   - Implemented collapsible sidebar for better space utilization
   - Added smooth transitions for sidebar state changes
   - Implemented tooltips for collapsed sidebar state
   - Maintained mobile responsiveness

## Completed Tasks
1. **Branch Setup**
   - Successfully created and switched to `cursor_002` branch
   - Verified existing codebase functionality

2. **Sidebar Enhancement**
   - Added collapse/expand functionality
   - Implemented smooth transition animations
   - Added tooltips for collapsed state
   - Maintained mobile responsiveness
   - Successfully committed changes to GitHub (commit: 97122bc)

## Next Steps
1. **Authentication**
   - Replace mock authentication with Supabase auth
   - Implement proper role-based access control

2. **Database Integration**
   - Set up Supabase client
   - Implement real-time data synchronization
   - Replace mock data with actual database operations

3. **Vehicle Management**
   - Implement bulk update functionality
   - Create vehicle management UI components
   - Add change log functionality

## Notes
- The project has a solid foundation with modern tooling and libraries
- Documentation is comprehensive and provides clear requirements
- Mobile responsiveness is a priority and is being maintained throughout development

## Questions/Concerns to Address
1. Supabase integration strategy
2. Testing strategy for new components
3. State management approach for larger application features
