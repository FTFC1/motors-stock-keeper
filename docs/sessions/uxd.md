Diagram or montage of different types of user controls being used in Cluster (e.g. text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, buttons,
toggles)

Module 10: Checklists for improving fidelity

181

KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
1. What input controls (e.g., text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes) are most appropriate for each type of
input?
Example

In Cluster, use a rich text editor for content creation, dropdowns for predefined categories,
and checkboxes for multiple selection of tags.

2. How are input errors and validation handled visually and interactively?
Example

For Cluster's "Create New Cluster" form, provide real-time validation for the cluster name,
showing a green checkmark for valid inputs and red error messages for invalid ones.

3. Are input labels clear, concise, and informative?
Example

Instead of "Enter text" for Cluster's content input, use specific labels like "Enter article title"
or "Paste content URL here".

4. How does the design accommodate different input methods (e.g., touch, keyboard, voice)?
Example

Ensure Cluster's interface works well with both mouse and touch input, and consider voice
input for content dictation on mobile devices.

Module 10: Checklists for improving fidelity

BEST PRACTICES:
Choose appropriate input controls based on the type of data being collected.
Example

Use a calendar picker for selecting dates in Cluster's content scheduling feature, rather
than a free-form text field.

Provide clear and concise labels for each input field.
Example

Label Cluster's AI settings fields descriptively, like "Summary Length" instead of just
"Length".

Use placeholder text to provide examples or hints for expected input format.
Example

In Cluster's tag input field, use placeholder text like "Enter tags separated by commas".

Validate input in real-time and provide clear error messages and resolution guidance.
Example

When a user tries to create a cluster with a duplicate name, immediately show an error
message suggesting alternative names.

Enable autofill and autocomplete where possible to speed up data entry.
Example

Implement autocomplete for Cluster's user search when adding collaborators to a project.

182

Module 10: Checklists for improving fidelity

Group related inputs together logically.
Example

In Cluster's content creation form, group all metadata fields (like tags, category, and
publish date) in one section.

Provide clear affordances for interactive elements.
Example

Make sure Cluster's clickable input areas (like dropdowns and checkboxes) are sufficiently
large and visually distinct.

Consider progressive disclosure for complex input scenarios.
Example

In Cluster's advanced search, initially show basic search fields, with an option to reveal
more detailed filters.

183

System navigation

Module 10: Checklists for improving fidelity

185

KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
1. How are navigation options categorized and labeled (e.g., product, contextual, system, global)?
Example

In Cluster, categorize navigation into "Content" (clusters, library), "Team" (collaboration),
"Analytics", and "Settings".

2. How is global navigation (e.g., main menu, breadcrumbs) visually distinguished from local navigation
(e.g., within a section or component)?
Example

Use a persistent left sidebar for Cluster's global navigation, and tabs or sub-menus within
specific cluster views for local navigation.

3. What navigation patterns (e.g., tabs, accordions, carousels) are used for organizing and accessing
content?
Example

Use tabs to organize different views within a Cluster (e.g., "Overview", "Content", "Analytics",
"Settings").

4. How does the navigation adapt or simplify for different screen sizes and device types?
Example

On mobile devices, collapse Cluster's main navigation into a hamburger menu to save
space.

Module 10: Checklists for improving fidelity

BEST PRACTICES:
Use clear and concise labels for navigation options.
Example

In Cluster, use straightforward labels like "My Clusters", "Team", "Analytics" instead of clever
or ambiguous terms.

Organize navigation options logically by user goals and information hierarchy.
Example

Group all content creation and management options together in Cluster's navigation.

Distinguish navigation levels visually (e.g., by size, placement, style).
Example

In Cluster, make the main navigation prominent and always visible, while sub-navigation
within a cluster view can be smaller and contextual.

Provide breadcrumbs or visual indicators of the current location within the navigation hierarchy.
Example

Show breadcrumbs in Cluster like "My Clusters > Marketing Campaign > Blog Post" to
help users understand their location.

Ensure navigation is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.
Example

On smaller screens, Cluster's navigation could collapse into a dropdown or off-canvas
menu.

186

Module 10: Checklists for improving fidelity

Use consistent navigation patterns across the interface.
Example

If using a dropdown for selecting clusters in one part of Cluster, use a similar pattern for
other selection tasks.

Provide shortcuts or quick access to frequently used sections.
Example

Include a "Recent Clusters" dropdown in Cluster's global navigation for quick access.

Consider using sticky navigation for long scrolling pages.
Example

Keep Cluster's main navigation visible even when scrolling through a long content list.

Elements of visual style
Visual style is a crucial aspect of user interface design that can significantly impact the user experience. It
encompasses various elements such as spacing, colors, elevation, iconography, typography, imagery, motion,
and texture.

Each section will provide key considerations and best practices to help you make informed decisions quickly.
We'll also include examples related to our Cluster project to demonstrate how these principles can be applied
in a real-world scenario.

Module 11: Checklists for improving visual style

Prerequisites
Before diving into the checklists for improving visual style, ensure that you have the following:

1. A basic understanding of design principles and color theory.
Example

Familiarity with concepts like balance, contrast, hierarchy, and color harmonies.

2. Access to design software capable of creating and editing visual elements.
Example

Figma, Sketch, Penpot, or similar tools where you can manipulate visual properties.

3. Your project's brand guidelines or style guide, if available.
Example

For Cluster, have the established color palette, typography choices, and any existing visual
style rules on hand.

4. A clear understanding of your target audience and the context in which they'll use your interface.
Example

Know that Cluster users are primarily content creators and marketers who will use the tool
professionally.

5. Familiarity with your project's technical constraints and capabilities.
Example

nderstand the limitations and possibilities of implementing various visual styles in
Cluster's web based environment.

spacing
Spacing is a fundamental aspect of visual design that impacts readability, hierarchy, and overall user
experience. Proper use of spacing can guide the user's eye, group related elements, and create a sense of
order and balance in your interface.

Reference

Example of two variations of spacing between Cluster's UI cards and redlining the spacing between text in those cards (these
are content cards from bookmarked web content added to the dashboard)

Module 11: Checklists for improving visual style

193

KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
1. How can we use spacing to create visual hierarchy and improve readability?
Consider the relationship between different elements and how spacing can emphasize or

de-emphasize them.
Example

In Cluster, use more generous spacing around primary actions like "Create New Cluster"
to make them stand out.

2. What layout patterns (e.g., grid, columns, whitespace) will best organize the content?
Determine the most appropriate layout structure for your content and user goals.
Example

Implement a flexible grid system for Cluster's content cards, allowing them to reflow based
on screen size while maintaining consistent spacing.

3. How does spacing change across different screen sizes and resolutions?
Plan for how your spacing will adapt responsively to various devices.
Example

On mobile devices, reduce the spacing between Cluster's content cards to maximize the
use of limited screen real estate.

4. Are we using consistent spacing units throughout the interface?
Establish a spacing scale and stick to it for consistency.
Example

Define a base spacing unit (e.g., 8px) for Cluster and use multiples of this unit throughout
the interface.

Module 11: Checklists for improving visual style

194

BEST PRACTICES:
Use a consistent spacing system based on a defined scale.
Example

In Cluster, use a spacing scale of 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, etc., to maintain visual rhythm
across the interface.

Apply the principle of proximity to group related elements.
Example

INNOVATING VS. REPRODUCING: RULES OF THUMB
Aim for originality, but don't be afraid to learn from the past.
Example

When designing Cluster's content organization system, look at existing solutions but aim
to improve upon them.

Embrace the remix and adapt ideas from outside your domain.
Example

Consider how file management systems in operating systems could inspire Cluster's
content clustering approach.

Don't get hung up on being 100% original — focus on solving problems.
Example

If a standard dropdown menu works best for Cluster's user selection, use it rather than
inventing a new interaction just for the sake of originality.

In the following sections, we'll explore the five levels of the originality spectrum, providing guidance on when
and how to use each approach in your design process. Remember, the goal is to create effective solutions,
not necessarily to reinvent the wheel every time.

Module 12: Checklists for innovating

227

Direct copies

Look for standard, non-differentiating features that users expect to work in familiar ways.
Example

For Cluster, consider directly copying standard layouts for login forms, settings pages, or
basic navigation menus.

2. Ensure you have the legal right to use any designs or concepts you're copying.
Be aware of potential copyright or patent infringement issues.
Example

If considering copying a unique content organization system from another tool, consult
with your legal team first.

3. Consider how direct copies might impact your product's unique value proposition.
Evaluate whether the copied element supports or detracts from your core features.
Example

While Cluster might use a standard layout for user profiles, ensure it doesn't overshadow
the unique AI-powered content analysis features.

4. Plan for how you might iterate on direct copies in the future.
Think about how you can use direct copies as a starting point for customization.
Example

Start with a standard list view for Cluster's content library, but plan future iterations that

incorporate AI-driven organization.

Module 12: Checklists for innovating

BEST PRACTICES:
Use direct copies for rapid prototyping and early-stage development.
Example

Quickly mock up Cluster's dashboard using a standard analytics dashboard layout to get
early user feedback.

Credit your inspirations when appropriate, especially in learning contexts.
Example

If Cluster's initial content tagging system is based directly on another tool, acknowledge
this in your team discussions or documentation.

Test copied designs with your specific users and use cases.
Example

Even if using a standard design for Cluster's content editor, still conduct usability tests to
ensure it meets your users' specific needs.

Use direct copies as a benchmark for improvement.
Example

Implement a basic content organization system copied from a competitor, then use it as a
baseline to measure the improvements of your AI-enhanced version.

Be cautious about copying unique or trademarked features.
Example

Avoid directly copying any patented AI algorithms or unique interaction patterns from
competitor content management tools.

229

Module 12: Checklists for innovating

Consider the familiarity and learnability benefits of using standard patterns.
Example

Use standard icons and layouts for common actions in Cluster (like a gear for settings) to
leverage users' existing mental models.

Don't rely solely on direct copies for core, differentiating features of your product.
Example

While Cluster might use standard elements for basic functions, its core AI-powered
content analysis should be uniquely designed.

Be prepared to justify your use of direct copies to stakeholders.
Example

If choosing to directly copy a standard file upload interface, be ready to explain how this
allows you to focus resources on Cluster's unique features.

232

KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Identify which existing designs or concepts could be combined to solve your problem.
Look for successful elements from various sources that could work well together.
Example

For Cluster's content organization system, consider combining the tagging system from a
social media platform with the folder structure of a file management system.

2. Determine how to integrate different elements cohesively.
Think about how to create a seamless user experience when combining disparate elements.
Example

When merging a social media-style feed with a traditional document library for Cluster,
ensure the transition between views is intuitive.

3. Evaluate how the remix improves upon the original concepts.
Consider whether the combination offers genuine benefits over using either concept alone.
Example

Assess if combining AI-powered content suggestions with a traditional search function
truly enhances the user's ability to find relevant information in Cluster.

4. Consider potential challenges in implementation and user adoption.
Think about technical feasibility and how users might react to the hybrid solution.
Example

If remixing a drag-and-drop interface with an AI-powered auto-organizer, consider how to
make the interaction clear and predictable for users.

Module 12: Checklists for innovating

BEST PRACTICES:
Choose elements to remix based on their proven effectiveness and relevance to your problem.
Example

For Cluster's collaborative features, remix the real-time editing capabilities of Google Docs
with the threaded comments of GitHub.

Ensure the remixed solution maintains consistency and coherence.
Example

When combining a card-based layout with a list view in Cluster, maintain consistent visual
styles and interaction patterns.

Test the remixed solution thoroughly to identify any usability issues.
Example

Conduct user testing to ensure that the combination of AI-suggested content and manual
curation in Cluster doesn't confuse users.

Be prepared to iterate on your remix based on user feedback.
Example

If users struggle with a remixed navigation combining a sidebar and top bar, be ready to
refine the design based on their input.

Document your remixing process to help stakeholders understand your design decisions.
Example

Create a brief explanation of how and why you combined specific elements for Cluster's
content creation interface.

233

Module 12: Checklists for innovating

Consider how the remixed solution fits with other elements of your interface.
Example

Ensure that a remixed content organization system in Cluster still works seamlessly with
the existing search and filter functions.

Don't force incompatible elements together just for the sake of remixing.
Example

Avoid combining a complex, data-heavy dashboard with a minimalist, focus-oriented
writing interface in Cluster if they serve different user needs.

Be mindful of potential licensing issues when remixing proprietary designs.
Example

If inspired by a unique interaction from a patented interface, consult with legal experts to
ensure your remix doesn't infringe on intellectual property rights.

Module 12: Checklists for innovating

236

KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Identify analogous problems or situations in other domains.
Look for similarities in process, user needs, or desired outcomes across different fields.
Example

Consider how library cataloging systems might inform Cluster's content organization
features.

2. Analyze how solutions from other domains could be adapted to your context.
Think about what modifications would be necessary to make the borrowed concept work in your field.
Example

Explore how the concept of "playlists" from music apps could be applied to organize
content in Cluster.

3. Evaluate the potential benefits and risks of introducing unfamiliar concepts.
Consider both the innovative potential and the possible learning curve for users.
Example

Assess whether using a map-based interface (inspired by GPS apps) for navigating
through content in Cluster would be intuitive or confusing for users.

4. Determine how to communicate the parallel to users effectively.
Think about how to make the borrowed concept feel natural in its new context.
Example

If applying a "recipe" metaphor to content creation workflows in Cluster, consider how to
present this idea in a way that feels relevant to content management.

Module 12: Checklists for innovating

BEST PRACTICES:
Cast a wide net when looking for parallels, considering diverse fields and industries.
Example

Look at how project management tools, social media platforms, and even video games
organize and present information for inspiration for Cluster.

Focus on the underlying principles of the parallel, not just surface-level similarities.
Example

When inspired by a dating app's matching algorithm, focus on the principle of intelligent
recommendations rather than the specific interface elements.

Use indirect parallels to challenge assumptions and break out of conventional thinking.
Example

Question whether Cluster's content organization must be hierarchical by looking at how
non-hierarchical systems in nature (like neural networks) organize information.

Test the adapted solution with users to ensure it translates well to your domain.
Example

If implementing a "garden" metaphor for content growth and curation in Cluster, conduct
user testing to ensure the concept resonates with your target audience.

Be prepared to explain and justify your use of indirect parallels to stakeholders.
Example

Create a brief presentation explaining how principles from urban planning could improve
content discovery in Cluster.

237

Module 12: Checklists for innovating

Consider how the indirect parallel might affect your product's learning curve.
Example

If introducing a novel, physics-based interaction for content organization, plan for
appropriate onboarding and user education.

Don't force a parallel that doesn't truly fit your product's needs or user expectations.
Example

Avoid implementing a complex, game-like achievement system in Cluster if it doesn't align
with users' professional content management needs.

Be mindful of cultural differences when drawing parallels from other domains.
Example

If using a sports metaphor for team collaboration features, ensure it translates well across
different cultures where your product might be used.

238

Module 12: Checklists for innovating

Module 12: Checklists for innovating

240

KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Identify appropriate metaphors or analogies that align with your users' experiences.
Choose concepts that your target audience will likely understand and relate to.
Example

For Cluster's content organization system, consider a "library" metaphor with "shelves" for
different topics and "books" for individual pieces of content.

2. Evaluate how well the metaphor or analogy maps to your product's functionality.
Ensure the chosen concept accurately represents your product's features and interactions.
Example

If using a "garden" metaphor for Cluster, map features like content creation to "planting,"
curation to "pruning," and content growth to "blooming".

3. Consider the scalability of the metaphor as your product evolves.
Think about whether the chosen analogy can accommodate future features or expansions.
Example

If using a "solar system" metaphor for content relationships in Cluster, consider how it
might adapt to include new types of content or connections.

4. Assess potential cultural or contextual limitations of the metaphor.
Be aware that some metaphors may not translate well across different cultures or user groups.
Example

A "baseball diamond" metaphor for project stages might work well in the US but could be
confusing for users in countries where baseball isn't popular.

Module 12: Checklists for innovating

BEST PRACTICES:
Use metaphors to simplify complex concepts or interactions.
Example

Represent Cluster's AI-powered content analysis as a "smart assistant" that helps users
organize and understand their information.

Ensure visual design and interactions align with the chosen metaphor.
Example

If using a "recipe book" metaphor for content templates in Cluster, design the interface to
visually resemble a cookbook with "ingredients" (content elements) and "instructions"
(formatting guidelines).

Avoid overextending metaphors beyond their useful limits.
Example

While a "file cabinet" metaphor might work for basic content organization in Cluster, don't
force it to represent more complex features like real-time collaboration.

Test metaphors with users to ensure they enhance rather than hinder understanding.
Example

Conduct user testing to verify that a "journey" metaphor for content creation in Cluster
actually helps users navigate the process more intuitively.

Be prepared to adapt or change metaphors based on user feedback.
Example

If users find a "laboratory" metaphor for Cluster's experimental AI features confusing, be
ready to explore alternative analogies.

241

Module 12: Checklists for innovating

Use metaphors consistently throughout your interface and documentation.
Example

If adopting a "workshop" metaphor for Cluster's content creation space, maintain this
theme in feature names, icons, and help documentation.

Consider using multiple, complementary metaphors for different aspects of your product.
Example

Use a "canvas" metaphor for Cluster's content editor and a "gallery" metaphor for the
content showcase feature.

Don't let metaphors overshadow your product's actual functionality.
Example

While a "magic wand" metaphor for Cluster's AI tools can be engaging, ensure it doesn't
make the actual capabilities seem more advanced than they are.

242

244

KEY CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Identify areas where existing solutions are inadequate or non-existent.
Look for pain points or opportunities that haven't been addressed by current products.
Example

For Cluster, consider how current content management systems fail to leverage AI for
deep content understanding and organization.

2. Challenge fundamental assumptions about how things should work.
Question established norms and practices in your field.
Example

Challenge the assumption that content must be organized in a hierarchical structure,
exploring entirely new ways of conceptualizing information relationships.

3. Envision ideal outcomes without constraints.
Think about perfect solutions before considering limitations.
Example

Imagine a Cluster interface that instantly understands and organizes content without any
user input, then work backwards to see what's achievable.

4. Consider emerging technologies or research that could enable new solutions.
Stay informed about advancements that could make previously impossible ideas feasible.
Example

Explore how cutting-edge natural language processing could enable a conversational
interface for content management in Cluster.

Module 12: Checklists for innovating

BEST PRACTICES:
Encourage a culture of experimentation and risk-taking.
Example

Allocate time for Cluster team members to work on "blue sky" ideas, even if they seem
impractical at first.

Use design thinking methodologies to approach problems from new angles.
Example

Conduct empathy interviews with Cluster users to uncover deep, unarticulated needs that
could inspire innovative solutions.

Collaborate across disciplines to bring diverse perspectives to the problem.
Example

Bring together AI researchers, UX designers, and content strategists to brainstorm entirely
new approaches to content management for Cluster.

Be prepared for multiple iterations and potential failures.
Example

If developing a novel AI-driven interface for Cluster, plan for extensive prototyping and
testing phases, with the understanding that many versions may not work.

Consider the long-term implications and scalability of truly innovative ideas.
Example

When designing a groundbreaking content organization system for Cluster, think about
how it could adapt to future content types or scale to enterprise-level use.

245

Module 12: Checklists for innovating

Balance innovation with usability and learnability.
Example

If creating a revolutionary gestural interface for Cluster, ensure it's intuitive enough for
users to adopt without extensive training.

Protect your innovations through proper intellectual property measures.
Example

If Cluster develops a unique AI algorithm for content analysis, consider patenting the
technology.

Don't innovate for innovation's sake - ensure it solves real user problems.
Example

Avoid implementing a complex 3D visualization of content relationships in Cluster if a
simpler solution would meet user needs more effectively.

PATTERNS FOR CHUNKING

Module 13: Patterns for chunking

247

CHUNKING

Chunking is a cognitive strategy that involves breaking down large amounts of information into smaller, more
manageable "chunks." In user interface design, chunking helps users process and understand information
more easily, reducing cognitive load and improving the overall user experience.

This module will explore various patterns for implementing chunking in your designs, with a focus on
how these can be applied to our Cluster project. We'll cover the following patterns

Card-based Layout

Tabs and Accordion

Grouped form field

Paginatio

Carousels and Sliders

Each of these patterns offers unique ways to organize and present information, making it easier for users to
navigate, comprehend, and interact with complex interfaces.

Module 15: Patterns for cognitive load

248

Each of these patterns offers unique ways to organize and present information, making it easier for users to
navigate, comprehend, and interact with complex interfaces.

Spacing

Reference

Example of the Cluster's dashboard of bookmarked items (only showing the text title) with zero organization or grouping patterns
(e.g. all cluster buckets are wide open, very little grid system or hierarchy). We use this as the starting point for making corrections in
each section.

As we explore each pattern, we'll use this unorganized Cluster dashboard as a starting point, demonstrating
how different chunking techniques can dramatically improve its usability and visual appeal.

Let's dive into our first pattern: Card-based Layouts.

Module 13: Patterns for Chunking

249

Card-based layouts

Card-based layouts organize content into discrete, rectangular containers that resemble physical cards. This
pattern is particularly effective for displaying collections of similar items, such as articles, products, or in the
case of Cluster, content pieces or projects.

Spacing

Example of a card layout showing different content clusters (e.g., 'AI wearable technology', 'Blockchain in healthcare') more
Reference

organized into neat UI content cards with a date, avatars of project members and the date the content was added.

Module 13: Patterns for Chunking

250

Benefits and Use Case
Organizes diverse content. Cards provide a consistent format for presenting various types of content,
making it easier for users to scan and compare items

Example: In Cluster, use cards to display different content clusters, each containing a title, brief
description, and key metadata

Supports responsive design. Cards can easily reflow and resize to fit different screen sizes and
orientations

Example: Cluster's card layout can adjust from a multi-column grid on desktop to a single column on
mobile devices

Facilitates modularity. Cards encapsulate content and functionality, making it easier to add, remove, or
rearrange items

Example: Allow Cluster users to drag and drop content cards to reorganize their dashboard or move
items between clusters

Provides clear interaction targets. Each card acts as a distinct, clickable unit, improving touch
interactions on mobile devices

Example: Make each content card in Cluster tappable to view full details or edit the content.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Chunking. Cards naturally break content into discrete, manageable units, aiding information processing
and recall

Example: Each card in Cluster represents a distinct piece of content or project, helping users mentally
organize their work

Recognition over recall. Cards often use visual cues like images or icons, making it easier for users to
recognize content rather than having to remember text-based information

Example: Include topic icons or content type indicators on Cluster cards to help users quickly identify
different types of content

Gestalt principle of proximity. Grouping related information within a card leverages the principle that
items close together are perceived as related

Example: Group related metadata (e.g., date added, collaborators, tags) within each Cluster card to
reinforce their association with the main content.

Module 13: Patterns for Chunking

Implementation Guidelines

Comparison: Wrong way - cluttered cards with too much information; 

Reference

Right way - clean, focused cards with key details and clear hierarchy

251

Module 13: Patterns for Chunking

D

Use consistent card sizes and layouts to create a cohesive loo

Include clear, descriptive titles for each car

Provide visual hierarchy within cards to highlight the most important informatio

Use white space effectively to prevent cards from feeling cluttere

Implement hover states or subtle animations to indicate interactivity



DON'

Overload cards with too much information or functionalit

Use cards for single, linear processes where a different pattern might be more appropriat

Neglect to provide clear calls-to-action within or related to the card

Use inconsistent styling across cards, which can confuse user

Forget about accessibility considerations, such as proper contrast and keyboard navigation

252

Module 13: Patterns for Chunking

Tabs and accordions

Tabs and accordions are both patterns that allow users to switch between different views or sections of
content within the same space. Tabs typically appear as a row of clickable headers, with only one tab's
content visible at a time. Accordions are vertically stacked headers that can be expanded or collapsed to
reveal or hide their associated content.

255

Module 13: Patterns for Chunking

256

Benefits and Use Case
Organizes related content. Both tabs and accordions group related information, making it easier for
users to find what they're looking for

Example: Use tabs in Cluster to separate different types of content within a project (e.g., "Research",
"Drafts", "Published Content")

Saves space. These patterns allow you to present a lot of information in a compact area without
overwhelming the user

Example: Use an accordion in Cluster to display and hide detailed metadata for each content piece,
saving space on the main view

Facilitates comparison. Tabs make it easy for users to switch between different categories of
information for comparison

Example: Implement tabs in Cluster's analytics section to allow users to quickly switch between
different metrics views (e.g., "Engagement", "Shares", "Comments")

Provides context. The visible headers in both patterns give users an overview of available content

Example: Use accordion headers in Cluster to show all available sections of a document, even when
some are collapsed.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Chunking. Both tabs and accordions break content into manageable sections, aiding in information
processing

Example: In Cluster, use tabs to chunk different stages of the content creation process (e.g., "Ideation",
"Writing", "Editing", "Publishing")

Progressive disclosure. These patterns reveal information progressively, reducing cognitive load

Example: Use accordions in Cluster's settings page to hide advanced options, revealing them only
when users choose to expand those sections

Recognition over recall. The visible headers aid recognition memory, helping users quickly find the
section they need

Example: In Cluster's project view, use clearly labeled tabs for different content categories, allowing
users to recognize and select the desired section.

Module 13: Patterns for Chunking

Implementation Guidelines

Spacing

Comparison: Wrong way - too many tabs or unclear labeling; 

Reference

Right way - logical grouping and clear, concise labels

257

Module 13: Patterns for Chunking

D

Use clear, concise labels for tab and accordion header

Indicate the currently active tab or expanded accordion sectio

Consider using icons alongside text in tab or accordion headers to enhance recognitio

Ensure that the content within each tab or accordion section is cohesive and relevant to the heade

Provide smooth transitions when switching between tabs or expanding/collapsing accordions



DON'

Use tabs or accordions for content that users need to see simultaneousl

Nest accordions too deeply, as this can become confusing and hard to navigat

Use these patterns for sequential tasks or information that needs to be consumed in a specific orde

Overload tabs or accordions with too many section

Hide critical information or primary actions behind tabs or in collapsed accordions

258

Module 13: Patterns for Chunking

Grouped form fields

Grouped form fields organize related input fields together, typically within a visual container or under a
common subheading. This pattern helps users understand the relationships between different pieces of
information they're entering and makes complex forms more manageable.

Spacing

Reference

Example of a form for creating a new cluster with fields grouped by 'Cluster Details' and 'Collaboration Settings

259

Module 13: Patterns for Chunking

260

Benefits and Use Case
Improves form comprehension. Grouping related fields helps users understand the overall structure of
the form and the relationships between different pieces of information

Example: In Cluster's content creation form, group fields related to the content itself (title, body, tags)
separately from publishing settings (scheduled date, target audience)

Reduces cognitive load. By breaking a long form into smaller, logical sections, users can focus on one
group of related fields at a time

Example: When setting up a new project in Cluster, group fields for project details, team members, and
content settings into separate sections

Enhances mobile usability. Grouped fields can be more easily displayed and navigated on smaller
screens

Example: On Cluster's mobile interface, display each group of fields on its own screen, with navigation
between groups

Facilitates progressive disclosure. Less important or advanced options can be grouped separately and
initially hidden

Example: In Cluster's user profile settings, group advanced privacy settings separately and collapse
them by default.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Chunking. Grouping related fields chunks information into more manageable units, aiding in information
processing and recall

Example: In Cluster's content analytics setup, group metrics related to engagement, sharing, and
conversion separately

Gestalt Principle of Proximity. Fields that are visually grouped together are perceived as related,
reinforcing the logical structure of the form

Example: In Cluster's team management interface, visually group fields for each team member (name,
role, permissions) to reinforce their relationship

Progressive Disclosure. By grouping fields, you can more easily hide or reveal sets of related options as
needed

Example: In Cluster's content editor, group advanced formatting options separately and allow users to
expand this group when needed.

Module 13: Patterns for Chunking

Implementation Guidelines

Spacing

Comparison: Wrong way - long, unorganized form; 

Reference

Right way - fields grouped by theme and with clear section headers

261

Module 13: Patterns for Chunking

D

Use clear, descriptive labels for each group of field

Visually distinguish groups using borders, background colors, or spacin

Consider using expandable/collapsible groups for less frequently used option

Ensure that the grouping makes logical sense and follows a natural progressio

263

Pagination

Pagination is a pattern used to divide content into separate pages, allowing users to navigate through a large
set of items or a long piece of content. This pattern is commonly used for search results, product listings, long
articles, or any scenario where displaying all content at once would be overwhelming or impractical.

Spacing

Reference

Example of pagination for a long list of content items within a cluster

Module 13: Patterns for Chunking

264

Benefits and Use Case
Manages large datasets. Pagination allows users to browse through large amounts of content without
overwhelming them with information

Example: In Cluster, use pagination to display search results when users are looking for specific
content across multiple projects

Improves performance. By loading only a subset of content at a time, pagination can significantly
improve page load times and reduce server load

Example: In Cluster's content library, paginate the list of articles to load only 20 items at a time,
improving load times for users with large content collections

Provides clear navigation. Pagination offers users a sense of where they are within a large set of content
and how much more is available

Example: In Cluster's analytics dashboard, use pagination for historical data reports, showing users
which time period they're viewing and how many more periods are available

Supports bookmarking and sharing. Paginated content can often be more easily bookmarked or
shared at specific points

Example: Allow Cluster users to share links to specific pages of search results or content listings.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Chunking. Pagination breaks large amounts of information into smaller, more manageable chunks,
reducing cognitive load

Example: In Cluster's content library, paginate long lists of articles into groups of 10-20, making it easier
for users to process and remember what they've seen

Sense of progress. Numbered pages give users a sense of progress as they move through content,
supporting the Goal-Gradient Effect

Example: In Cluster's onboarding tutorial, use numbered pages to show users their progress through
the guide, motivating them to complete it

Avoiding choice overload. By limiting the number of items displayed at once, pagination can prevent
users from feeling overwhelmed by too many choices

Example: In Cluster's template library, paginate template options to show a manageable number at a
time, preventing users from feeling overwhelmed by choices.

Carousels and sliders

Carousels and sliders are interactive elements that display a collection of items in a limited space, allowing
users to scroll or slide through the content horizontally. While similar, carousels typically rotate automatically
and are often used for promotional content, whereas sliders are usually manually controlled and can be used
for various types of content.

Module 13: Patterns for Chunking

268

Benefits and Use Case
Saves space. Carousels and sliders allow you to display multiple items in a compact area, making efficient
use of screen real estate

Example: Use a carousel on Cluster's dashboard to showcase featured projects or recently active
content clusters

Highlights multiple items. These elements can draw attention to several important pieces of content
without overwhelming the user

Example: Implement a slider in Cluster to display top-performing content pieces across different
categories

Provides interactive exploration. Users can browse through a set of related items in an engaging,
interactive way

Example: Use a slider in Cluster's template library to allow users to browse through different content
templates

Supports visual content. Carousels and sliders are particularly effective for showcasing visual content
like images or videos

Example: In Cluster's media library, use a slider to allow users to browse through thumbnails of images
and videos.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Curiosity. The partially hidden content in carousels and sliders can pique users' curiosity, encouraging
exploration

Example: In Cluster's featured content carousel, show a glimpse of the next item to encourage users to
keep exploring

Recency effect. By showcasing the most recent or relevant content, carousels leverage the
psychological tendency to remember and prioritize the most recent information

Example: Use a carousel on Cluster's dashboard to highlight the user's most recently edited or viewed
content

Reduced choice overload. By presenting a limited number of options at a time, carousels and sliders can
prevent users from feeling overwhelmed by too many choices

Example: In Cluster's content recommendation feature, use a slider to present a few relevant content
suggestions at a time, rather than a long list.

Progressive disclosure
Solves for the following mental models:
Filtering - Models for filtering important details from the nois
Recall - Models for deciding which information to hold or trade from our limited memory ban
Efficiency - Models for using information to make decisions with limited time and uncertainty

Progressive disclosure is an interaction design technique that sequences information and actions across
several screens. The goal is to reduce feelings of overwhelm for the user.
By disclosing information progressively, you reveal only the essentials, then expand with details as the user
requests them. You can hide less frequently used options until needed.
It was introduced in 1983 by IBM interface specialists John M. Carroll and Mary Rosson who discovered that
hiding advanced functionality early on led to the increased success of its use.
In modern software, we can use "drilldown patterns" to achieve progressive disclosure. The anatomy of these
patterns consists of
Trigger. This is the behavior that engages the pattern such as a button click or a mouse hover
Container. This is the block containing the secondary information or functionality, such as a modal or
popup
Contextual reference. This is a visual reference to the "parent" view or data, such as a transparent overlay
or a breadcrumb. Its purpose is to reference the primary information. This allows the user to retain context
about where they came from without having to hold it in their active memory (a limited resource!).

Example of a disorganized dashboard of clusters. We can use one of the disorganized starting points from the previous examples
or a mix and mash of a few examples. We use this as the starting point for making corrections in each section dashboard of
clusters.

In the context of Cluster, progressive disclosure can be particularly useful for managing the complexity of
content organization and collaboration features. For example, instead of displaying all possible actions for a
content cluster at once, we can progressively reveal options as the user interacts with the interface.


We'll cover the following patterns for managing complexity

Tooltips and popovers

Tooltips and popovers are small containers that display additional information about an element when the
user interacts with it. Tooltips appear when hovering over an element and provide brief explanatory text, while
popovers are triggered by a click and can contain more detailed information or actions. Both are used to
progressively disclose information without overwhelming the user.

Note

Example of a popover displaying a team member's role and contact information when clicking on their profile picture

In Cluster, tooltips could be used to explain unfamiliar AI features, while popovers might display detailed
information about collaborators or content items without navigating away from the main view.

275

Module 14: Patterns for progressive disclosure

276

Benefits and Use Case
Provides context. Tooltips and popovers provide additional context about an element without taking up
valuable screen real estate
Example: In Cluster, use tooltips to explain AI-powered features like "Auto-summarize" or "Content
suggestion" without cluttering the interface
Reduces cognitive load. By hiding extra information behind a hover or click, users can access it only
when needed, reducing the amount of information they need to process at once
Example: Use popovers in Cluster to display detailed metadata about a content item, such as creation
date, author, and tags, only when a user requests more information
Defining new or complex terms. If your interface includes terminology that may be unfamiliar to users,
tooltips can define those terms when hovered over, making the interface easier to learn
Example: Provide tooltips for AI-related terms in Cluster, such as "semantic analysis" or "natural
language processing," to help users understand these concepts
Displaying extra data. Popovers can show additional data related to an element when clicked, such as a
mini profile when clicking on a user's name
Example: In Cluster's collaboration features, use popovers to display team member profiles, including
their role, recent activity, and contact information.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Filtering. Tooltips allow users to access additional information without cluttering the main interface,
helping them focus on the essential details
Example: In Cluster's content dashboard, use tooltips to provide quick summaries of content items,
allowing users to filter relevant information without opening each item
Recall. By providing definitions or explanations in tooltips, users don't have to remember the meaning of
every term, reducing the burden on their memory
Example: Use tooltips in Cluster to remind users of keyboard shortcuts or the meaning of icons,
reducing the need to memorize these details
Efficiency. Popovers can contain quick actions related to an element, letting users access common tasks
without navigating to a separate page
Example: Implement popovers in Cluster that allow users to quickly edit tags, move content to different
clusters, or share items without leaving their current view.

Nested menus
Nested menus are a type of progressive disclosure pattern that organizes navigation options into hierarchical
levels. Each menu item can expand to reveal a set of sub-items, allowing users to drill down through the
information architecture.

Example of a nested menu for sorting clusters by different criteria (e.g., "Sort by" > "Date Created", "Last Updated", "Team Members")

For Cluster, nested menus could be used to organize content types, filter options, or navigation through
different levels of content organization.

Module 14: Patterns for progressive disclosure

282

Benefits and Use Case
Organizes information hierarchy. Nested menus allow you to organize features, pages or categories into
a hierarchical structure. This makes the overall information architecture clearer and easier to navigate
Example: In Cluster, use nested menus to organize content types (e.g., "Content" > "Articles" > "News",
"Blog Posts", "Research Papers")
Reduces cognitive load. By breaking down options into categories and subcategories, nested menus
reduce the number of choices a user has to process at once. They can drill down to their desired option
step-by-step
Example: Organize Cluster's AI features in a nested menu (e.g., "AI Tools" > "Content Analysis",
"Summarization", "Topic Suggestion")
Provides fast access to deep content. Nested menus give users a way to quickly jump to specific pages
or features that are nested deep within the site structure, bypassing intermediary navigation steps
Example: Allow users to quickly access specific content clusters or projects in Cluster through a nested
menu structure
Works well for broad and deep architectures. If your product has a wide range of features or content
categories, with several levels of hierarchy, nested menus can make that complexity manageable
Example: Use nested menus in Cluster to manage complex content hierarchies, team structures, and
project organizations.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Filtering. Nested menus act as a filtering mechanism, guiding users through the different levels of
information step-by-step. At each level, irrelevant options are hidden, allowing the user to focus only on the
category they are interested in
Example: In Cluster's content browser, use nested menus to filter content by type, then by topic, then by
author, progressively narrowing down the user's focus
Recall. The hierarchical structure of nested menus serves as a type of external memory. Instead of having
to recall the location of an item from memory, the user can rely on the menu categories to guide them,
reducing the burden on their own memory
Example: Structure Cluster's project navigation as a nested menu, allowing users to navigate through
teams, projects, and individual content pieces without having to remember exact locations
Efficiency. For users that are familiar with the menu structure, nested menus allow quick access to specific
deep pages. The user doesn't have to navigate through intermediary pages, but can go directly to their
destination, making navigation very efficient
Example: Implement keyboard shortcuts in Cluster that allow power users to quickly navigate through
nested menu structures, enhancing efficiency for frequent tasks.

DON'
Mix different types of categories at the same level - keep each level thematically consisten
Use nested menus for primary navigation unless the information architecture justifies i
Have categories that only contain one item in them - there's no need for an additional leve
Make menu hover areas too small, as that makes sub-menus difficult to engage wit
Incorporate actions (like Delete or Edit) directly in menus - keep menus for navigation only

Expandable rows
Expandable rows are interface components that allow users to progressively disclose content within a page
or view. They consist of a header or summary that can be clicked to expand or collapse the detailed content
below. This allows the page to be skimmed easily, with users able to drill down into sections of interest.

In Cluster, expandable rows can be particularly useful for displaying content summaries, project details, or
team information in a compact, easily scannable format.

286

Module 14: Patterns for progressive disclosure

287

Benefits and Use Case
Organizes content. Expandable rows break content into clear, organized chunks that are easy to
navigate and comprehend
Example: In Cluster's dashboard, use expandable rows to display project summaries, with the ability to
expand each row to show more detailed information about content, team members, and progress
Reduces scrolling. By hiding detailed content until needed, expandable sections decrease the need for
lengthy scrolling, especially on mobile devices
Example: In Cluster's content library, use expandable rows to show content titles and brief summaries,
allowing users to expand items of interest to view full details, metadata, and related content
Providing additional details. Expandable rows are great for providing supplementary information that
not all users may need, such as advanced settings or detailed explanations
Example: In Cluster's AI settings, use expandable rows to hide advanced configuration options,
allowing power users to access these settings when needed without overwhelming novice users
Focusing attention. Collapsing less important sections helps to focus attention on the most critical
content
Example: In Cluster's analytics view, use expandable rows to show high-level metrics for each content
piece, with the option to expand for detailed performance data and insights.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Filtering. Expandable rows allow users to hide extraneous details and focus only on the content that
matters to them
Example: In Cluster's team management view, use expandable rows to show basic team information,
allowing users to expand only the teams they're interested in to see member details and current
projects
Recall. By chunking content into memorable sections with clear headers, expandable sections decrease
the burden on users' memory. They don't have to remember all the details, just the high-level categories
Example: Structure Cluster's help documentation using expandable rows, organizing information into
clear categories that users can easily remember and expand when needed
Efficiency. Users can quickly access the specific content they need without having to scroll through
irrelevant information, making the interface more efficient to navigate
Example: In Cluster's content creation workflow, use expandable rows to organize different stages
(e.g., "Research", "Draft", "Review"), allowing users to quickly jump to and expand the relevant stage.

Module 14: Patterns for progressive disclosure

292

Benefits and Use Case
Preserves context. Drawers and sheets allow users to access additional content or features while still
keeping the main view visible, maintaining their context within the app
Example: In Cluster, use a drawer to display detailed content metadata without navigating away from the
main content view
Saves screen space. By hiding content off-screen until needed, drawers and sheets make efficient use of
limited screen real estate, especially on mobile devices
Example: Implement a bottom sheet in Cluster's mobile interface for adding new content, preserving the
full screen for content browsing
Houses navigation. Side drawers are commonly used for navigation menus, providing access to main app
sections without dedicating permanent screen space
Example: Use a left-side drawer in Cluster to house the main navigation menu, including links to
Dashboard, Projects, Teams, and Settings
Provides options. Action sheets can display a set of options or tools related to a specific item, such as
sharing or editing choices for a selected piece of content
Example: When a user selects a content item in Cluster, use a bottom sheet to reveal options like Edit,
Share, Move, or Delete.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Filtering. Drawers can contain filtering options that let users narrow down the main content, helping them
focus on what's most relevant
Example: Implement a right-side drawer in Cluster that houses advanced filtering options for content,
allowing users to refine their view based on criteria like date, author, or AI-generated tags
Recall. By keeping the main view visible while displaying supplementary content, drawers and sheets
reduce the need for users to remember their previous location in the app
Example: When editing content metadata in Cluster, use a side drawer that allows users to make
changes while still seeing the main content, reducing the cognitive load of remembering what they're
editing
Efficiency. Quick access to navigation via a drawer or context-specific actions in a sheet allows users to
perform common tasks more efficiently
Example: Implement a quick-action bottom sheet in Cluster that provides easy access to common
tasks like creating new content, starting a new project, or inviting team members.

Module 14: Patterns for progressive disclosure

298

Benefits and Use Case
Demands attention. Modals ensure that critical information or actions are noticed by the user and not
overlooked
Example: Use a modal in Cluster to confirm the deletion of a project or important content piece, ensuring
the user doesn't accidentally perform an irreversible action
Reduces errors. By requiring confirmation for potentially destructive actions, modals can prevent users
from making unintended mistakes
Example: When a user attempts to remove a team member from a Cluster project, use a modal to
confirm the action and explain its consequences
Editing information. Modals provide a focused space to edit information without losing the context of the
original page
Example: Use a modal in Cluster for quick edits to content metadata, allowing users to make changes
without navigating away from their current view
Displaying media. Modals can be used to show larger versions of images, videos, or other media without
navigating away from the current page
Example: When a user clicks on a thumbnail in Cluster's content library, use a modal to display a larger
preview of the content along with key metadata.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Filtering. Modals temporarily hide the main interface, helping users focus solely on the modal's content
without distractions
Example: When reviewing an AI-generated summary in Cluster, use a modal to display the summary,
allowing users to focus entirely on the content without the distraction of the main interface
Recall. By keeping modals concise and focused on a single task, users don't have to remember as much
information at once
Example: In Cluster's content tagging modal, display only the necessary fields for adding or editing tags,
reducing the cognitive load on the user
Efficiency. Modals allow users to complete self-contained tasks like editing data or confirming deletions
without losing their place in the main interface
Example: Use a modal in Cluster for quick content creation, allowing users to add new items efficiently
without navigating to a separate page.

Module 14: Patterns for progressive disclosure

303

Benefits and Use Case
Reduces cognitive load. By hiding extra details behind a click, Read More links allow users to scan the
main points before diving into more comprehensive information
Example: In Cluster's content library, show brief summaries of articles or reports with Read More links to
expand the full text
Improves scannability. Showing only excerpts or summaries makes it easier for users to quickly skim the
page and find content that interests them
Example: On Cluster's dashboard, display truncated project descriptions with Read More links, allowing
users to quickly scan multiple projects
Keeps the page concise. Read More links keep the initial page shorter and less overwhelming while still
providing access to all the content
Example: In Cluster's AI-generated content summaries, show a condensed version with a Read More
link to reveal the full analysis
Works well for listings. For pages that list multiple articles or text-heavy items, Read More links can neatly
truncate each item while giving users control over which ones they expand
Example: In Cluster's team activity feed, use Read More links to truncate longer updates, allowing users
to expand only the ones they're interested in.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Filtering. Read More links allow users to filter out non-essential details on their initial scan of the page and
focus only on the summary information
Example: In Cluster's content analytics page, use Read More links to hide detailed metrics, allowing
users to focus on high-level data and expand for more in-depth analysis as needed
Recall. By keeping the main page concise and scannable, Read More links reduce the burden on users'
memory as they don't need to process and recall every detail upfront
Example: In Cluster's project overview, use Read More links for detailed project descriptions, allowing
users to remember just the key points from the summary
Efficiency. Users can efficiently access just the level of detail they need - the summary when scanning, or
the full text when a particular item captures their interest
Example: In Cluster's content creation workflow, use Read More links to provide quick access to writing
guidelines or best practices, allowing users to efficiently access this information only when needed.

Cognitive load
Cognitive load refers to the amount of mental effort required to process information and complete tasks. In
user interface design, managing cognitive load is crucial for creating intuitive and efficient experiences. By
reducing cognitive load, we can help users focus on their primary tasks without feeling overwhelmed or
frustrated.
In this module, we'll explore various patterns that can help reduce cognitive load in your designs, with a
particular focus on how these can be applied to our Cluster project. We'll cover the following patterns:

Let's dive into our first pattern: Pagination and infinite scroll.

Module 15: Patterns for cognitive load

308

Pagination and infinite scroll
Pagination and infinite scroll are two approaches to managing large sets of content or data. Pagination divides
content into discrete pages that users can navigate through, while infinite scroll continuously loads more
content as the user scrolls down the page. Both patterns aim to reduce cognitive load by presenting
manageable amounts of information at a time.

Module 15: Patterns for cognitive load

310

Benefits and Use Case
Manages large datasets. Both patterns allow users to browse through large amounts of content without
being overwhelmed by information overload
Example: In Cluster, use pagination for search results when users are looking for specific content across
multiple projects
Improves performance. By loading only a subset of content at a time, both patterns can significantly
improve page load times and reduce server load
Example: Implement infinite scroll in Cluster's content feed, loading new items as the user scrolls,
improving performance for users with large content collections
Provides clear navigation (Pagination). Pagination offers users a sense of where they are within a large
set of content and how much more is available
Example: In Cluster's analytics dashboard, use pagination for historical data reports, showing users
which time period they're viewing and how many more periods are available
Supports continuous browsing (Infinite Scroll). Infinite scroll allows for a more seamless browsing
experience, which can be beneficial for exploratory tasks
Example: Use infinite scroll in Cluster's content discovery feed, allowing users to continuously browse
through recommended content items.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Chunking. Both patterns break large amounts of information into smaller, more manageable chunks,
reducing cognitive load
Example: In Cluster's content library, use pagination to break long lists of articles into groups of 10-20,
making it easier for users to process and remember what they've seen
Progressive Disclosure. These patterns reveal information gradually, preventing users from feeling
overwhelmed by too much content at once
Example: Implement infinite scroll in Cluster's team activity feed, progressively loading older activities as
the user scrolls, rather than displaying all activities at once
Sense of Progress (Pagination). Numbered pages give users a sense of progress as they move through
content, supporting the Goal-Gradient Effect
Example: In Cluster's onboarding tutorial, use numbered pagination to show users their progress
through the guide, motivating them to complete it.

315

Benefits and Use Case
Simplifies complex processes. By breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps, users can focus on
one part of the process at a time
Example: In Cluster, use a stepper for the process of creating a new project, guiding users through
naming, setting up collaborators, and initial content organization
Provides clear progress indication. Users can see where they are in the process and how many steps
remain
Example: Implement a wizard for Cluster's AI configuration process, showing users their progress as
they set up automated content analysis and summarization features
Reduces errors. By focusing on one step at a time, users are less likely to make mistakes or overlook
important information
Example: Use a stepper in Cluster's content publishing workflow, ensuring users complete all necessary
steps like adding tags, setting permissions, and scheduling before publishing
Improves completion rates. The clear structure and progress indication can motivate users to complete
all steps
Example: Implement a wizard for Cluster's onboarding process, guiding new users through profile setup,
initial content creation, and team invitations.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Chunking. Steppers and wizards break down complex processes into smaller, more manageable chunks,
reducing cognitive load
Example: In Cluster's content creation workflow, use a stepper to separate the process into distinct
phases: ideation, drafting, editing, and publishing
Progressive Disclosure. These patterns reveal information and options gradually, preventing users from
feeling overwhelmed
Example: In Cluster's AI setup wizard, progressively disclose advanced options in each step, allowing
users to configure basic settings first before diving into more complex options

Module 15: Patterns for cognitive load

320

Benefits and Use Case
Reduces decision fatigue. By limiting navigational choices, users spend less mental energy deciding
where to go
Example: In Cluster's main interface, use a minimalist top navigation with only essential sections like
"Dashboard", "Projects", "Team", and "Settings"
Focuses user attention. A simplified navigation structure helps guide users to the most important areas of
the application
Example: In Cluster's content editor, minimize navigation options to focus user attention on the writing
and editing process
Improves mobile usability. Minimalist navigation is particularly beneficial on smaller screens where space
is limited
Example: For Cluster's mobile interface, use a bottom navigation bar with only the most crucial options,
hiding less frequently used features in a menu
Enhances learnability. With fewer options to remember, new users can more quickly understand and
navigate the interface
Example: In Cluster's onboarding process, introduce new users to a simplified navigation structure,
gradually revealing more advanced options as they become familiar with the platform.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Hick's Law. This principle states that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and
complexity of choices. Minimalist navigation reduces choices, speeding up decision-making
Example: In Cluster's project view, limit the primary navigation options to essential actions like "Edit",
"Share", and "Analyze", reducing the time users spend deciding what to do next
Cognitive Load Theory. By presenting fewer navigation options, minimalist design reduces the amount of
information users need to process, lowering cognitive load
Example: In Cluster's analytics dashboard, use a minimalist sidebar navigation to organize different types
of reports, making it easier for users to find and focus on the data they need
Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Minimalist navigation improves the signal-to-noise ratio by emphasizing important
elements (signal) and reducing distractions (noise)
Example: In Cluster's content creation interface, minimize navigation elements to emphasize the content
editor, reducing distractions and helping users focus on their writing.

324

Module 15: Patterns for cognitive load

325

Benefits and Use Case
Improves comprehension. By grouping related items together, users can more easily understand the
structure and relationships within the information
Example: In Cluster, chunk content items within a project into categories like "Research Materials," "Draft
Content," and "Published Articles.
Enhances scannability. Chunked lists are easier to scan quickly, helping users find specific information
faster
Example: In Cluster's search results, chunk findings into categories like "Matching Projects," "Relevant
Content," and "Team Members.
Aids memory recall. Chunking information makes it easier for users to remember and recall items from the
list
Example: In Cluster's dashboard, chunk recent activities into groups like "Your Recent Actions," "Team
Updates," and "AI-Generated Insights.
Reduces overwhelm. Breaking down long lists into smaller groups helps prevent users from feeling
overwhelmed by large amounts of information
Example: In Cluster's content library, chunk articles into groups based on topics or themes, rather than
presenting a long, undifferentiated list.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Chunking. This principle directly applies here - our brains are better at processing and remembering
information when it's grouped into meaningful units
Example: In Cluster's project overview, chunk task lists into groups like "To Do," "In Progress," and
"Completed" to help users better process and remember their workload
Miller's Law. This principle suggests that the average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in
their working memory. Chunking helps work within this limitation
Example: In Cluster's main navigation, group features into no more than 5-9 main categories to align with
Miller's Law
Gestalt Principle of Proximity. Items that are close together are perceived as more related than items
that are farther apart
Example: In Cluster's content editor, visually chunk related formatting options together (e.g., text styling in
one group, alignment in another) to make the toolbar easier to use.

Benefits and Use Case
Increases completion rates. Simpler forms are less intimidating and quicker to fill out, leading to higher
completion rates
Example: In Cluster, use a simplified form for quick content addition, asking only for a title and URL, with
optional fields for more details
Reduces errors. With fewer fields and clearer instructions, users are less likely to make mistakes
Example: In Cluster's project creation form, use smart defaults and pre-filled suggestions to reduce the
chance of errors
Improves user experience. Simplified forms feel less overwhelming and more respectful of users' time
and effort
Example: For Cluster's user registration, create a minimalist form asking only for essential information,
allowing users to add more details later
Speeds up data entry. With fewer fields to fill and smart defaults, users can complete forms more quickly
Example: In Cluster's content tagging system, provide a simplified form with auto-suggestions based on
existing tags and AI analysis of the content.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Cognitive Load Theory. Simplified forms reduce the amount of information users need to process,
lowering cognitive load
Example: In Cluster's settings page, simplify complex configuration options into a series of toggle
switches with clear labels, reducing the cognitive load of understanding and adjusting settings
Hick's Law. By reducing the number of fields and options, simplified forms speed up the decision-making
process
Example: In Cluster's content categorization form, limit category options to a manageable number, or
use a smart search instead of a long dropdown list
Progressive Disclosure. This principle can be applied to forms by revealing additional fields only when
they're relevant, based on previous answers

Visual hierarchy
Visual hierarchy is a fundamental principle in user interface design that guides users' attention and helps them
understand the importance and relationships between different elements on a page. By effectively using
visual hierarchy, designers can create intuitive, easy-to-navigate interfaces that reduce cognitive load and
improve user experience.
In this module, we'll explore various patterns for creating effective visual hierarchy, with a particular focus on
how these can be applied to our Cluster project. We'll cover the following patterns:
Typograph
Color and contras
Whitespace and groupin
Size and scal
Proximity and alignment

Module 16: Patterns for visual hierarchy

Each of these patterns offers unique strategies to organize and present information in ways that guide users'
attention and improve the overall usability of your interface.

Spacing

Reference

Example of a dashboard with non-obvious hierarchy cluster content. We can use one of the disorganized starting points from the
previous examples or a mix and mash of a few examples. We use this as the starting point for making corrections in each section

As we explore each pattern, we'll use this cluttered and visually confusing Cluster dashboard as a starting
point, demonstrating how different visual hierarchy techniques can dramatically improve its usability and user
experience.
Let's dive into our first pattern: Typography.

Module 16: Patterns for visual hierarchy

335

Typography
Typography plays a crucial role in establishing visual hierarchy within an interface. Effective use of typography
can guide users' attention, improve readability, and convey the relative importance of different pieces of
information.

336

Module 16: Patterns for visual hierarchy

337

Benefits and Use Case
Establishes information hierarchy. Different font sizes, weights, and styles can indicate the relative
importance of various text elements
Example: In Cluster, use a large, bold font for project titles, a slightly smaller font for section headers, and
a standard size for body text
Improves readability. Proper typography enhances the legibility of text, making it easier for users to
consume information
Example: Use a clean, sans-serif font for Cluster's interface text to ensure readability across different
screen sizes and resolutions
Conveys brand identity. Typography choices can reinforce your product's personality and brand
Example: Select a modern, professional typeface for Cluster that aligns with its identity as an innovative
content management tool
Guides user attention. Strategic use of typography can direct users to important information or calls-toaction
Example: Use a distinct, attention-grabbing typography style for Cluster's "Create New Project" button to
make it stand out.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Visual Saliency. Distinctive typography draws attention to important elements, leveraging the brain's
tendency to notice standout items
Example: In Cluster's content editor, use a unique typography style for AI-generated suggestions to
make them visually distinct from user-written content
Fitts's Law. Larger text is easier to interact with, especially on touch devices, making important actions
more accessible
Example: Use larger, well-spaced text for clickable elements in Cluster's mobile interface, such as
menu items or action buttons
Cognitive Load Theory. Consistent and well-structured typography reduces the mental effort required to
process information
Example: Maintain consistent typography styles across Cluster for similar types of information (e.g., all
project titles use the same style), reducing the cognitive load of interpreting the interface.

Directs user attention. Larger elements naturally draw the eye and can be used to highlight important
information or actions
Example: In Cluster, use a larger size for the primary action button (e.g., "Create New Cluster") to make it
stand out from secondary actions
Creates visual hierarchy. Varying sizes of elements can establish a clear order of importance
Example: Use larger thumbnails for frequently accessed or high-priority content in Cluster's dashboard,
and smaller thumbnails for less crucial items
Improves usability. Appropriately sized elements can make interfaces more user-friendly, especially on
touch devices
Example: Ensure that clickable elements in Cluster's mobile interface are large enough for easy tapping
(at least 44x44 pixels)
Enhances visual interest. Varying sizes and scales can create a more dynamic and engaging layout
Example: In Cluster's content overview, use different sizes for content cards based on their importance
or recency to create a visually interesting grid.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Visual Saliency. Larger elements are more visually salient and thus capture attention more easily
Example: In Cluster's analytics dashboard, use larger numbers and charts for key metrics to ensure
they're immediately noticeable
Fitts's Law. Larger targets are easier to interact with, reducing the time and effort required for user actions
Example: Make frequently used buttons in Cluster, like "Save" or "Share," slightly larger to improve
usability

Benefits and Use Case
Creates logical groupings. Proximity helps users understand which elements are related to each other
Example: In Cluster's content editor, place formatting options close together and separate them from
other tools like save or share buttons
Improves scanability. Proper alignment creates clean lines that guide the eye, making it easier to scan
and comprehend information
Example: Align all project titles to the left in Cluster's dashboard for easy scanning and comparison
Enhances aesthetics. Well-aligned elements create a sense of order and professionalism in the
interface
Example: Ensure all elements in Cluster's settings panel are precisely aligned, creating a clean and
organized appearance
Clarifies relationships. Proximity and alignment can show hierarchical relationships between elements
Example: In Cluster's team management view, use indentation to show hierarchical relationships
between team members and their roles.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Gestalt Principle of Proximity. Elements that are close together are perceived as related or part of a
group
Example: In Cluster's content organization interface, place related actions (like "Move," "Copy," "Delete")
close together to indicate they're part of the same action group
Gestalt Principle of Continuation. Aligned elements create a sense of order and continuity, guiding the
eye through the interface
Example: Align the titles of all content pieces in a Cluster project, creating a clear line that guides users
as they scan through the list
Law of Prägnanz. Well-organized, aligned interfaces are perceived as simpler and more orderly, reducing
cognitive load
Example: Use consistent alignment throughout Cluster's interface to create a sense of order and
simplicity, making the tool feel easier to use.

System feedback

Feedback and visibility are crucial elements in user interface design that help users understand what's
happening in the system, confirm their actions, and provide guidance. Effective feedback and visibility
patterns can significantly improve the user experience by reducing uncertainty, preventing errors, and guiding
users through complex processes.


In this module, we'll explore various patterns for implementing feedback and visibility in your designs, with a
focus on how these can be applied to our Cluster project.

We'll cover the following patterns

Progress bars and loader

Notifications and alert

Confirmation message

Real-time validatio

Contextual help

Each of these patterns offers unique ways to provide users with information about system status, action
results, and guidance, making your product more intuitive and user-friendly.

Let's dive into our first pattern: Progress bars and loaders

384

Module 18: Patterns for feedback and visibility

385

Progress bars and loaders

Progress bars and loaders are visual indicators that inform users about the status of ongoing processes or
tasks. They help manage user expectations by providing visibility into system operations that might otherwise
seem opaque or unresponsive.

Reference

Example of a progress bar indicating the percentage of content items that have been summarized within a cluster

Module 18: Patterns for feedback and visibility

Reference

Example of a loader animation while the AI is generating a summary of a newly added piece of content

386

Manages user expectations. Progress indicators give users a sense of how long a process will take,
reducing uncertainty and frustration

In Cluster, use a progress bar to show the status of bulk content import, indicating what percentage of
items have been processed

Provides a sense of control. Even if users can't interact during a process, seeing progress gives them a
feeling of control and involvement

When generating an AI summary in Cluster, show a animated loader with a percentage complete,
helping users feel informed about the process

Prevents premature abandonment. For longer processes, progress indicators can encourage users to
wait for completion rather than assuming the system has frozen

During the initial setup of a new Cluster project, use a multi-step progress bar to show users how far
along they are in the setup process

Offers feedback for background processes. Progress indicators can keep users informed about tasks
happening in the background

Show a subtle progress bar in Cluster's header when syncing changes across devices, allowing users
to continue working while staying informed.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Goal-Gradient Effect. As users see progress towards completion, their motivation to finish the task
increases

In Cluster's onboarding process, use a progress bar showing steps completed, motivating users to finish
setting up their account

Uncertainty Reduction Theory. Progress indicators reduce uncertainty about system status, which can
alleviate user anxiety

When uploading large files to a Cluster, show both a progress percentage and estimated time remaining
to reduce user uncertainty

Feedback Loop. Progress indicators create a feedback loop, constantly updating users on system status
and their own actions

In Cluster's content analysis feature, use a real-time updating progress bar to show how many content
pieces have been analyzed, creating a continuous feedback loop.

418

Module 19: Patterns for error prevention and handling

419

Benefits and Use Case
Encourages exploration. Users are more likely to try new features if they know they can easily undo their
actions

In Cluster, allow users to undo changes to AI-generated summaries, encouraging them to experiment
with different summarization settings

Reduces anxiety. The ability to undo mistakes can make users feel more confident and less anxious
when using the interface

Provide an undo option when users delete content from a Cluster, giving them a chance to recover
accidentally deleted items

Improves efficiency. Undo/redo can be faster than manually reversing an action, especially for complex
operations

Allow users to undo/redo bulk tagging actions in Cluster, making it easy to correct mistakes when
organizing large amounts of content

Supports non-linear workflows. Users can easily backtrack and try different approaches to a task

In Cluster's content editor, provide undo/redo for formatting changes, allowing users to easily compare
different styles.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Error Recovery. Undo/redo supports the principle of error recovery, reducing user stress and
encouraging exploration

In Cluster's team management section, allow users to undo changes to team member roles, providing a
safety net for accidental changes

Locus of Control. Undo/redo functions give users a greater sense of control over the interface and their
actions

Provide global undo/redo functionality in Cluster, allowing users to reverse or reapply actions across
different parts of the interface

Forgiveness. This pattern embodies the principle of forgiveness in interface design, allowing users to
recover from mistakes easily

and warning them that the deletion is permanent

423

Module 19: Patterns for error prevention and handling

424

Benefits and Use Case
Prevents accidental actions. Dialogs can stop users from unintentionally performing irreversible or
significant actions

In Cluster, use a confirmation dialog when a user attempts to delete an entire project, ensuring they
understand the consequences

Provides additional context. Dialogs can offer more information about an action before it's taken

When a user tries to leave a Cluster content editor with unsaved changes, show a dialog explaining the
consequences and offering options to save or discard

Captures user attention. Dialogs temporarily block interaction with the main interface, ensuring
important messages are seen

Use a dialog in Cluster when inviting new team members, to confirm permissions and send a
customized invitation message

Simplifies complex decisions. Dialogs can break down complex choices into simpler, focused
interactions

When applying bulk actions to multiple pieces of content in Cluster, use a dialog to confirm the action
and allow users to refine their selection.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Attention Focus. Dialogs direct user attention to a specific task or decision, reducing distractions

In Cluster's AI settings, use a dialog to focus user attention on important configuration choices that
affect multiple features

Error Prevention. By requiring confirmation for critical actions, dialogs support the principle of error
prevention

When a user attempts to remove a team member from a Cluster project, show a dialog explaining the
impact on shared content and asking for confirmation

Information Scent. Dialogs can provide additional information, improving the user's understanding of
available actions and their consequences

In Cluster's content publishing workflow, use a dialog to provide a summary of the content to be
published and any potential conflicts or issues.

427

Autosave and drafts

Autosave and drafts are features that automatically save user progress at regular intervals or when specific
actions are performed. This pattern helps prevent data loss and allows users to easily resume their work, even
if they're interrupted or experience technical issues.

Example of an "Autosave" indicator appearing next to the "Edit Summary" button, letting the user know that their changes are
Reference

being automatically saved as they type

Module 19: Patterns for error prevention and handling

428

Example of a "Drafts" section in the user's profile, allowing them to access and resume working on summaries that they started but
Reference

haven't published yet

Module 19: Patterns for error prevention and handling

429

Benefits and Use Case
Prevents data loss. Autosave ensures that user work is not lost due to accidental closures, crashes, or
connection issues

In Cluster's content editor, implement autosave to preserve user's work every few minutes or after
significant changes

Reduces user anxiety. Knowing their work is automatically saved can make users feel more secure and
focused on their tasks

Show a subtle "Changes saved" indicator in Cluster's interface to reassure users that their work is being
preserved

Supports non-linear workflows. Drafts allow users to work on multiple items simultaneously and return
to them later

Provide a "Drafts" section in Cluster where users can access all their in-progress content across
different projects

Improves user experience. Autosave and drafts can create a seamless experience across devices and
sessions

Allow Cluster users to start working on content on their desktop and seamlessly continue on their
mobile device using autosaved progress.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Peace of Mind. Autosave reduces cognitive load by alleviating the need for users to remember to save
their work manually

In Cluster's AI-assisted writing feature, automatically save different versions as the user accepts or
rejects AI suggestions

Continuity. Drafts support the principle of continuity, allowing users to easily resume tasks across
different sessions or devices

When a Cluster user logs in, show a notification about any drafts they have in progress, making it easy to
pick up where they left off

Loss Aversion. Autosave addresses the psychological principle of loss aversion by protecting users from
losing their work

If a user's session in Cluster unexpectedly ends, ensure that all their recent changes are preserved in an
autosaved draft.

432

Error messages and suggestions

Error messages and suggestions are feedback mechanisms that inform users about problems and provide
guidance on how to resolve them. Effective error handling not only alerts users to issues but also offers clear,
actionable steps for correction.

Example of an error message appearing when the user attempts to add a piece of content that has already been added to the cluster,
Reference

suggesting that they search for the existing item instead

Module 19: Patterns for error prevention and handling

Example of an error message appearing when the AI summarization feature encounters an issue, providing a suggestion for

433

Module 19: Patterns for error prevention and handling

434

Benefits and Use Case
Guides problem-solving. Clear error messages with suggestions help users understand and resolve
issues quickly

In Cluster, if a user tries to create a cluster with a name that already exists, show an error message
suggesting alternative names or ways to differentiate the new cluster

Reduces frustration. Informative error handling can turn potentially frustrating experiences into learning
opportunities

When Cluster's AI feature fails to generate a summary, provide an error message explaining possible
reasons (e.g., content length, complexity) and suggest ways to optimize the content for better results

Improves system transparency. Well-crafted error messages can help users understand system
limitations and requirements

If a user tries to upload a file type not supported by Cluster, show an error message listing accepted file
types and explaining why certain formats are not allowed

Enhances user education. Suggestions accompanying error messages can teach users about best
practices and feature capabilities

When a user encounters an error while setting up a complex workflow in Cluster, provide suggestions
for simpler alternatives or link to relevant tutorials.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Informative Feedback. Clear error messages support the principle of informative feedback, helping
users understand what went wrong and why

In Cluster's team collaboration features, if a user tries to access content they don't have permission for,
explain why access is denied and how they can request permissions

Error Recovery. Suggestions for resolving errors support the principle of error recovery, empowering
users to correct mistakes and move forward

If a user's attempt to integrate a third-party tool with Cluster fails, provide step-by-step troubleshooting
suggestions in the error message

Learning Opportunity. Well-designed error messages can turn mistakes into learning opportunities,
enhancing the user's understanding of the system

When a user makes a mistake in Cluster's advanced search syntax, provide an error message that
explains the correct syntax and offers examples.

Accessibility

Accessibility in user interface design is about creating digital products that can be used by everyone,
including people with various disabilities. Implementing accessibility patterns not only makes your product
usable by a wider audience but also often improves the overall user experience for all users.

437

Module 20: Patterns for accessibility

438

In this module, we'll explore various patterns for implementing accessibility in your designs, with a focus on
how these can be applied to our Cluster project. We'll cover the following patterns

Keyboard navigatio

ARIA attribute

Alternative text for image

Color contras

Resizable text and zoom

Each of these patterns offers strategies to make your interface more accessible, ensuring that users with
different abilities can effectively use and navigate your product.

As we explore each pattern, we'll use examples from Cluster to demonstrate how these accessibility
techniques can be implemented in a real-world scenario, enhancing the usability of the platform for all users.

Let's dive into our first pattern: Keyboard navigation.

Module 20: Patterns for accessibility

439

Keyboard navigation

Keyboard navigation is a crucial accessibility feature that allows users to interact with an interface using only
a keyboard, without relying on a mouse or touchpad. This is essential for users with motor disabilities, as well
as power users who prefer keyboard shortcuts for efficiency.

441

Benefits and Use Case
Improves accessibility for users with motor disabilities who can't use a mouse

Example: In Cluster, ensure all interactive elements can be accessed and activated using only the
keyboard

Enhances efficiency for power users who prefer keyboard shortcuts

Example: Implement keyboard shortcuts in Cluster for common actions like creating a new cluster (Ctrl
+ N) or saving changes (Ctrl + S)

Provides an alternative navigation method for users with temporary injuries

Example: Allow users to navigate through Cluster's main sections (Dashboard, Projects, Analytics)
using the Tab key and arrow keys

Supports users who prefer or need to use assistive technologies

Example: Ensure Cluster's interface works seamlessly with screen readers and other assistive
technologies that rely on keyboard input.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Consistency. Keyboard navigation patterns should be consistent with standard web practices, supporting
users' existing mental models

Example: In Cluster, use standard keyboard interactions like Tab to move between elements and Enter
to activate buttons or links

Feedback. Provide clear visual feedback for keyboard focus, helping users understand their current
position in the interface

Example: Implement a distinct focus state for all interactive elements in Cluster, ensuring users can
easily track their position when navigating via keyboard

Efficiency. Keyboard shortcuts can significantly speed up interactions for experienced users, supporting
the principle of recognition over recall

Example: In Cluster's content editor, provide keyboard shortcuts for common formatting actions,
displaying them in tooltips to aid discovery and recall.

446

Benefits and Use Case
Enhances screen reader compatibility. ARIA attributes provide context and meaning to elements that
might not be clear from the HTML structure alone

Example: In Cluster, use aria-label to provide descriptive text for icon buttons, like "<button arialabel="Add new content to cluster">+</button>"

Improves navigation for assistive technology users. ARIA landmarks and roles help users understand the
structure of the page

Example: Use ARIA roles to clearly define different sections of Cluster's interface, such as "<nav
role="navigation">" for the main menu and "<main role="main">" for the primary content area

Clarifies dynamic content changes. ARIA attributes can announce updates to content without page
reloads

Example: In Cluster's real-time collaboration feature, use aria-live to announce when new comments or
edits are made by team members

Provides additional context for complex interactions. ARIA can explain the behavior of custom widgets that
don't have native HTML equivalents

Example: For Cluster's custom drag-and-drop interface for organizing content, use aria-grabbed and
aria-dropeffect to convey the interaction to screen reader users.

Psychological Principal Supporte
Mental Models. ARIA attributes help align the application's structure with users' mental models of web
interfaces, making navigation more intuitive

Example: Use aria-current="page" in Cluster's navigation menu to indicate the current active page,
reinforcing the user's mental model of their location in the app

Reduced Cognitive Load. By providing clear labels and roles, ARIA attributes reduce the cognitive effort
required to understand the interface structure

Example: In Cluster's complex data visualizations, use aria-describedby to link detailed text
descriptions to charts, reducing the cognitive load for users who can't perceive the visual information

Feedback Loop. ARIA attributes can provide immediate feedback on user actions, supporting the principle
of clear system communication

Example: Use aria-invalid and aria-describedby in Cluster's forms to provide immediate, accessible
feedback on input validation errors.

Displays text when images fail to load due to slow connections or errors

Example: Ensure all Cluster interface icons have meaningful alt text, like "<img src="add-icon.png"
alt="Add new item to cluster">"

Provides context for users who choose to disable images

Example: For Cluster's logo, use alt text that includes the company name: "<img src="clusterslogo.png" alt="Clusters logo">".

Psychological Principles Supporte
Equivalent Experience. Alt text supports the principle of providing an equivalent experience for all users,
regardless of their abilities

Example: In Cluster's data visualization features, provide detailed alt text that conveys the key insights
of charts and graphs

Cognitive Load Reduction. Well-written alt text can reduce the cognitive load for users by clearly and
concisely describing complex images

Example: For complex infographics in Cluster, use concise alt text to summarize the main point, with a
link to a full text description for more details

Module 20: Patterns for accessibility

461

Benefits and Uses Case
Improves readability for users with visual impairments

Example: In Cluster, implement a text resize feature in the user settings, allowing users to adjust the
base font size of the entire application

Enhances usability in different viewing conditions (e.g., on small screens or at a distance)

Example: Ensure Cluster's interface remains functional and well-organized when zoomed up to 200%
using browser zoom controls

Supports users with temporary visual needs (e.g., eye strain or forgotten reading glasses)

Example: In Cluster's content reading view, provide easily accessible controls to increase or decrease
text size for comfortable reading

Accommodates personal preferences for text size and layout

Example: Allow users to set their preferred text size in their Cluster profile, applying this preference
across all their devices.

Psychological Principles Supporte
User Control. Resizable text gives users a sense of control over their experience, supporting the
psychological need for autonomy

Example: In Cluster's settings, provide a range of text size options and a live preview, allowing users to
choose their optimal reading size

Adaptability. Zoom features support the principle of adaptable interfaces, allowing the system to meet
diverse user needs

Example: Design Cluster's layout to be fluid and responsive, maintaining usability and structure even
when zoomed to 200% or more

Reduced Cognitive Load. Properly sized text reduces the cognitive effort required to read and understand
content, especially for users with visual impairments

Example: In Cluster's data visualization features, ensure that all chart labels and legends can be easily
resized for better comprehension of complex information.

Patterns for
personalization

Module 21: Patterns for personalization

Personalization
Personalization in user interface design refers to the practice of tailoring the user experience to individual
users based on their preferences, behavior, or characteristics. Effective personalization can significantly
enhance user engagement, satisfaction, and productivity by providing a more relevant and streamlined
experience.

464

Module 21: Patterns for personalization

465

In this module, we'll explore various patterns for implementing personalization in your designs, with a focus on
how these can be applied to our Cluster project. We'll cover the following patterns
Customizable dashboard
Adaptive conten
Personalized recommendation
User preferences and setting
Localization and language selection
Each of these patterns offers unique strategies to create a more personalized and user-centric experience,
making your product more engaging and effective for individual users.
As we explore each pattern, we'll use examples from Cluster to demonstrate how these personalization
techniques can be implemented in a real-world scenario, enhancing the usability and appeal of the platform
for diverse users.
Let's dive into our first pattern: Customizable dashboards.

Module 21: Patterns for personalization

466

Customizable dashboards
Customizable dashboards allow users to tailor their primary interface to their specific needs and preferences.
This pattern enables users to choose which information and features are most prominent and accessible,
creating a more personalized and efficient user experience.

Example of providing a set of pre-designed dashboard templates for different use cases (e.g., 'Content Research', 'Team
Collaboration', 'Personal Organization')

Module 21: Patterns for personalization

468

Benefits and Use Case
Increases efficiency. Users can prioritize the information and tools they use most frequently
Example: In Cluster, allow users to drag and drop widgets like "Recent Projects," "Team Activity," and
"Content Analytics" to customize their dashboard layout
Accommodates diverse user needs. Different user roles or preferences can be catered to within the same
interface
Example: Provide pre-designed dashboard templates in Cluster for different roles like "Content
Creator," "Team Manager," and "Data Analyst.
Enhances user engagement. Customization can increase user investment in the platform
Example: Allow Cluster users to add or remove widgets based on their workflow, such as adding a
"Content Calendar" widget or removing unused features
Improves information hierarchy. Users can create a visual hierarchy that matches their mental model
Example: Enable Cluster users to resize widgets, allowing them to give more prominence to critical
information like project deadlines or team notifications.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Sense of Ownership. Customization fosters a sense of ownership over the interface, increasing user
satisfaction and engagement
Example: Allow Cluster users to save multiple dashboard configurations for different work modes or
projects
Self-Determination Theory. Customizable dashboards support the psychological need for autonomy,
allowing users to shape their work environment
Example: Provide options in Cluster for users to choose color themes or icon sets for their dashboard,
further personalizing their experience
Cognitive Load Reduction. By allowing users to prioritize relevant information, customizable dashboards
can reduce cognitive load
Example: Let Cluster users hide or minimize less frequently used features, decluttering their
workspace and focusing attention on key tasks.

Improves productivity. Customized settings can streamline workflows and reduce friction
Example: Allow Cluster users to set up custom keyboard shortcuts for frequently used actions
Supports privacy and security. User-controlled settings can enhance data privacy and account security
Example: Offer granular privacy controls in Cluster for sharing content, managing team access, and
controlling profile visibility.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Locus of Control. Customizable settings give users a sense of control over their environment, which can
increase satisfaction and reduce stress
Example: In Cluster, allow users to control the frequency and types of notifications they receive, giving
them power over their information flow
Self-Determination Theory. Providing choices supports the psychological need for autonomy, potentially
increasing intrinsic motivation to use the platform
Example: Offer Cluster users the ability to customize their workspace layout, supporting their need for
autonomy in how they organize their work
Cognitive Load Theory. By allowing users to tailor the interface to their preferences, cognitive load can be
reduced, making the app easier to use
Example: Let Cluster users hide or simplify complex features they don't need, reducing visual clutter
and cognitive overhead.

Localization and language selection
Localization and language selection features allow users to adapt the application's language, date formats,
numerical conventions, and cultural references to their preferences or location. This pattern is crucial for
creating a truly global and inclusive product.

Module 21: Patterns for personalization

488

Benefits and Uses Case
Expands global reach. Allows the application to serve users from diverse linguistic and cultural
backgrounds
Example: Offer Cluster's interface in multiple languages, allowing teams from different countries to
collaborate effectively
Enhances user comfort. Users can interact with the application in their preferred language, increasing
ease of use and reducing errors
Example: Allow Cluster users to set their preferred language independently of their location or device
settings
Improves accessibility. Language options can make the application accessible to users who might
otherwise be excluded
Example: Provide right-to-left (RTL) language support in Cluster for languages like Arabic or Hebrew
Supports legal and cultural compliance. Proper localization ensures adherence to local regulations and
cultural norms
Example: Adapt date formats, units of measurement, and currency displays in Cluster based on the
user's locale settings.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Linguistic Relativity. The language we use can shape our thinking. Allowing users to work in their native
language can enhance understanding and creativity
Example: In Cluster, ensure that AI-generated content suggestions adapt to the user's chosen
language, respecting linguistic nuances
Cultural Congruence. Aligning the interface with users' cultural expectations can increase comfort and
trust in the platform
Example: Adapt Cluster's icons, color schemes, and metaphors to be culturally appropriate for different
locales
Cognitive Fluency. Information presented in one's native language is typically processed more easily,
reducing cognitive load
Example: Provide Cluster's help documentation and tooltips in the user's selected language to
facilitate easier learning and problem-solving.

Onboarding

Onboarding and learning are crucial aspects of user experience design, especially for complex or feature-rich
applications. Effective onboarding can significantly impact user adoption, engagement, and long-term
retention. It helps new users understand the value of your product and quickly become proficient in using its
key features.

Module 22: Patterns for onboarding and learning

492

In this module, we'll explore various patterns for implementing onboarding and learning experiences in your
designs, with a focus on how these can be applied to our Cluster project. We'll cover the following patterns

Product tours and walkthrough

Contextual tips and hint

Interactive tutorial

Onboarding checklist

Help centers and documentation

Each of these patterns offers unique strategies to introduce users to your product, guide them through key
features, and provide ongoing support as they become more advanced users.

As we explore each pattern, we'll use examples from Cluster to demonstrate how these onboarding and
learning techniques can be implemented in a real-world scenario, enhancing the user experience and helping
users quickly become proficient with the platform.

Let's dive into our first pattern: Product tours and walkthroughs.

Module 22: Patterns for onboarding and learning

493

Product tours and walkthroughs

Product tours and walkthroughs are guided introductions to an application's interface and key features. They
help new users understand the layout of the application and highlight its most important functions, reducing
the initial learning curve and improving user adoption.

495

Benefits and Use Case
Provides a structured introduction to the application's key features and layout

Example: In Cluster, offer a guided tour of the main dashboard, highlighting sections like "My Clusters,"
"Recent Activity," and "AI Insights.

Reduces the initial learning curve for new users

Example: Walk new Cluster users through the process of creating their first content cluster, explaining
each step along the way

Highlights unique or differentiating features that users might otherwise miss

Example: Showcase Cluster's AI-powered content analysis features during the tour, explaining how
they can enhance productivity

Sets expectations for what users can accomplish with the application

Example: Conclude the Cluster tour with a summary of key benefits, such as improved content
organization and team collaboration.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Cognitive Load Reduction. By breaking down the interface into manageable chunks, tours reduce the
initial overwhelm new users might feel

Example: In Cluster's tour, introduce one main feature at a time, starting with cluster creation, then
moving to content adding, and finally team collaboration

Curiosity. Well-designed tours can pique users' interest in exploring more of the application

Example: Tease advanced Cluster features during the initial tour, encouraging users to explore further
after completing the basics

Self-Efficacy. Guided walkthroughs can boost users' confidence in their ability to use the application
effectively

Example: Include a "quick win" in Cluster's tour, such as successfully creating and naming a new
cluster, to give users an immediate sense of accomplishment.

Contextual tips and hints

Contextual tips and hints are small, targeted pieces of information that appear within the interface to guide
users as they interact with specific features or elements. These tips provide just-in-time guidance, helping
users understand how to use features or accomplish tasks without interrupting their workflow.

Hint

Try searching for a specific topic or keyword, like 'AI in healthcare'

Example of a small tip appearing next to the search bar when the user clicks on it, suggesting ways to refine their search (e.g.,

Module 22: Patterns for onboarding and learning

500

Benefits and Use Case
Provides guidance at the point of need, reducing cognitive load

Example: In Cluster, show a tip next to the content tagging field, suggesting popular tags or explaining
how tagging improves content discoverability

Helps users discover and understand features organically

Example: Display a hint when a user hovers over Cluster's AI analysis button, briefly explaining how it
can help summarize and categorize content

Encourages exploration of advanced features

Example: Show a tip highlighting Cluster's advanced search syntax when a user starts typing in the
search bar, encouraging more precise queries

Reinforces best practices and optimal usage patterns

Example: Provide a hint when users are setting up team permissions in Cluster, suggesting role-based
access for better security.

Psychological Principal Supporte
Just-in-Time Learning. Contextual tips support the principle of providing information exactly when it's
needed, enhancing retention and application

Example: In Cluster's content editor, provide context-sensitive writing tips based on the type of content
being created (e.g., blog post, social media update)

Progressive Disclosure. Tips and hints can progressively reveal more advanced features or concepts as
users become more familiar with the basic functionality

Example: Gradually introduce more advanced Cluster features through tips as users engage more
with the platform, such as AI-powered content suggestions after they've mastered basic content
creation

Curiosity. Well-crafted hints can spark users' interest in exploring features they might not have discovered
on their own

Example: Use a "Did you know?" format for some Cluster tips to introduce lesser-known but valuable
features, like advanced collaboration tools or analytics insights.

Module 22: Patterns for onboarding and learning

505

Benefits and Uses Case
Provides hands-on experience with key features

Example: Guide Cluster users through creating their first content cluster, adding content, and using AI
analysis tools

Enhances retention through active learning

Example: Have users complete a mini-project in Cluster, such as organizing a set of sample content
into themed clusters

Allows users to practice in a safe, guided environment

Example: Create a sandbox environment in Cluster where users can experiment with advanced
features like custom AI models without affecting real data

Builds user confidence in using the application

Example: Conclude Cluster's tutorial with a "graduation" task that combines multiple features,
celebrating the user's new skills.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Learning by Doing. Interactive tutorials leverage the principle that active engagement leads to better
understanding and retention

Example: In Cluster's tutorial, have users actively create tags, add content, and generate AI summaries,
rather than just showing them how it's done

Immediate Feedback. Providing instant feedback during tutorials reinforces correct actions and quickly
corrects mistakes

Example: When a user successfully invites a team member in Cluster's tutorial, show an encouraging
message and explain the collaboration benefits

Scaffolding. Tutorials can progressively introduce more complex concepts, building on previously learned
skills

Example: Start Cluster's tutorial with basic content organization, then introduce more advanced
features like AI-powered content suggestions and team collaboration tools.

Breaks down the onboarding process into manageable steps

Example: Divide Cluster's onboarding into sections like "Account Setup", "Content Management", and
"Team Collaboration", each with 2-3 tasks

Gives users a sense of progress and accomplishment

Example: Show a progress bar in Cluster that fills as users complete onboarding tasks, with
celebratory messages at key milestones

Encourages users to explore key features

Example: Include a task in Cluster's checklist to "Generate your first AI-powered summary", introducing
users to this unique feature.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Goal-Gradient Effect. As users get closer to completing the checklist, their motivation to finish increases

Example: In Cluster's onboarding checklist, show the percentage completed and emphasize how
close users are to finishing as they progress

Endowed Progress Effect. Giving users a head start on the checklist (e.g., by pre-checking some items)
can increase motivation to complete the rest

Example: Automatically check off "Create account" and "Set up profile" in Cluster's onboarding
checklist, showing users they've already made progress

Gamification. Turning onboarding into a series of achievements can make the process more engaging and
rewarding

Example: Award badges or points in Cluster for completing each onboarding task, with a special
reward for finishing the entire checklist.

Module 23: Patterns for information relationships

518

Information relationships
Information relationships in user interface design refer to the ways in which different pieces of content or data
are connected and organized within a system. Effective information relationships help users understand the
structure of your application, navigate through complex data sets, and find the information they need quickly
and intuitively.

Module 23: Patterns for information relationships

519

In this module, we'll explore various patterns for implementing and displaying information relationships in your
designs, with a focus on how these can be applied to our Cluster project. We'll cover the following patterns
Breadcrumbs and navigation trail
Sitemap
Tagging and labelin
Faceted search and filter
Related content suggestions
Each of these patterns offers unique strategies to help users understand and navigate the relationships
between different pieces of information in your application. By implementing these patterns effectively, you
can enhance the usability and intuitiveness of your interface, making it easier for users to find, understand, and
interact with the information they need.
As we explore each pattern, we'll use examples from Cluster to demonstrate how these information
relationship techniques can be implemented in a real-world scenario, enhancing the user's ability to navigate
and understand the complex web of content and data within the platform.
Let's dive into our first pattern: Breadcrumbs and navigation trails.

Module 23: Patterns for information relationships

520

Breadcrumbs and navigation trails
Breadcrumbs and navigation trails are user interface elements that show users their current location within an
application's hierarchy and provide a clear path back to higher levels. They help users understand their
context within a complex information structure and facilitate easy navigation.

Module 23: Patterns for information relationships

521

Benefits and Use Case
Provides context. Breadcrumbs show users where they are in the application's hierarchy, helping them
understand their current location
Example: In Cluster, display a breadcrumb trail like "Home > Projects > AI Research > Machine
Learning Models" when a user is viewing a specific content item
Facilitates easy navigation. Users can quickly jump back to higher levels in the hierarchy without using the
browser's back button
Example: Allow Cluster users to click on any level in the breadcrumb trail to navigate directly to that
section, such as jumping from a specific content item back to the "AI Research" project
Reduces disorientation. Navigation trails help users maintain their sense of location, especially in deep or
complex information architectures
Example: When users dive deep into nested clusters in Cluster, provide a clear trail showing their path,
like "Content Library > Technology > Artificial Intelligence > Machine Learning > Neural Networks"
Improves efficiency. Users can move between different sections of the application more quickly using
breadcrumbs
Example: In Cluster's content editor, provide a breadcrumb trail that allows users to quickly switch
between different sections of a long-form piece of content.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Spatial Memory. Breadcrumbs support users' spatial memory by providing a visual representation of their
location within the information hierarchy
Example: In Cluster's project view, use breadcrumbs to reinforce the hierarchical relationship between
projects, subprojects, and individual content items
Cognitive Load Reduction. By showing the user's current location and path, breadcrumbs reduce the
mental effort required to navigate complex information structures
Example: In Cluster's analytics dashboard, use breadcrumbs to help users understand which level of
data they're viewing (e.g., "All Projects > AI Research > Engagement Metrics")
Information Scent. Breadcrumbs provide "information scent," giving users cues about where they've been
and where they can go within the application
Example: In Cluster's search results, include breadcrumbs that show the filters or categories applied,
helping users understand how they arrived at the current set of results.

sections and features (e.g., "Dashboard", "Clusters", "Search", "Team", "Settings”)

Module 23: Patterns for information relationships

525

Benefits and Use Case
Provides an overview of site structure. Sitemaps give users a bird's-eye view of the application's
organization and content
Example: Create a visual sitemap for Cluster that shows the relationships between main sections like
"Projects," "Content Library," "Analytics," and "Team Management.
Facilitates navigation. Users can use sitemaps to quickly find and navigate to specific sections of the
application
Example: Implement a clickable sitemap in Cluster's help center, allowing users to easily locate
documentation for specific features or processes
Improves understanding of content organization. Sitemaps help users grasp how information is
categorized and related within the application
Example: Use a sitemap to illustrate the hierarchical structure of Cluster's content organization system,
showing how individual pieces of content relate to projects and themes
Supports SEO efforts. XML sitemaps help search engines understand and index the structure of your
application more effectively
Example: Generate an XML sitemap for Cluster's public-facing pages to improve search engine
visibility for features, use cases, and public content showcases.

Psychological Principal Supporte
Mental Mapping. Sitemaps support users in creating a mental model of the application's structure,
improving their overall understanding and navigation
Example: Provide an interactive sitemap in Cluster's onboarding process to help new users
understand the platform's structure and features
Information Architecture Comprehension. Visual sitemaps help users grasp complex information
hierarchies more easily than text-based navigation alone
Example: Use a visual, tree-like sitemap to illustrate the relationships between Cluster's projects,
subprojects, and content items
Spatial Memory. Well-designed sitemaps can leverage users' spatial memory, making it easier for them to
remember and locate information in the future
Example: Implement a consistent visual layout for Cluster's sitemap that mirrors the actual layout and
organization of the application.

Example of allowing users to add tags or labels to individual pieces of content within a cluster, to help categorize and organize
them (e.g., tagging an article as "Research" or "Opinion”)

Module 23: Patterns for information relationships

529

Benefits and Use Case
Improves content organization. Tags and labels create a flexible, non-hierarchical way to categorize
content
Example: Allow Cluster users to tag content items with relevant keywords like "Machine Learning,"
"Data Visualization," or "Research Paper.
Enhances searchability. Tags make it easier for users to find relevant content through search and filtering
Example: Implement a tag-based search in Cluster, allowing users to quickly find all content related to
specific topics or themes
Creates content relationships. Tags can reveal connections between seemingly unrelated pieces of
content
Example: Use a "Related Content" feature in Cluster that suggests items sharing similar tags to the one
currently being viewed
Supports user-generated organization. Allowing users to create and apply their own tags enables
personalized content organization
Example: Let Cluster users create custom tags for their projects and content, in addition to using
predefined system tags.

Psychological Principal Supporte
Associative Memory. Tags support associative thinking, helping users make connections between
different pieces of information
Example: In Cluster's content creation interface, suggest related tags based on the content's text,
helping users build associative networks of information
Recognition over Recall. Tags provide visual cues that help users recognize relevant topics without having
to recall specific search terms
Example: Display a tag cloud in Cluster's dashboard, showing frequently used tags to help users
quickly access common topics
Personalization. User-generated tags allow for personalized organization schemes, supporting individual
mental models
Example: Allow Cluster users to create personal tag collections for different projects or areas of
interest, facilitating personalized content organization.

533

Benefits and Uses Case
Simplifies complex information retrieval. Users can combine multiple search methods to find exactly what
they're looking for
Example: In Cluster, combine global search with faceted filters to allow users to search across all
content and then refine by type, tags, date range, and team member
Supports contextual exploration. Contextual search helps users find relevant information within their
current view or section
Example: Implement a contextual search within Cluster's content editor, allowing users to quickly find
and reference other content pieces within the same project
Enhances productivity with keyboard shortcuts. Power users can quickly access search functionality
without reaching for the mouse
Example: In Cluster, use the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + /" to focus on the global search bar from
anywhere in the application
Provides flexible search strategies. Different search patterns accommodate various user preferences and
search behaviors
Example: Allow Cluster users to initiate searches using global search, then refine results using faceted
filters, and further explore using contextual search within specific content areas.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Progressive Disclosure. Faceted search and contextual search reveal information complexity gradually,
reducing cognitive load
Example: In Cluster's analytics dashboard, use faceted filters to progressively reveal more detailed
data breakdowns as users apply filters
Recognition over Recall. Global search with autocomplete suggestions helps users recognize relevant
search terms without having to recall them exactly
Example: Implement intelligent autocomplete in Cluster's global search, suggesting content titles, tags,
and team members as the user types
Flexibility-Usability Tradeoff. Providing multiple search patterns (global, contextual, faceted) with keyboard
shortcuts caters to both novice and expert users
Example: In Cluster, offer a simple search bar for novice users, while providing advanced search syntax
and keyboard shortcuts for power users.

Module 23: Patterns for information relationships

Global Search Guideline

relevant items within the same cluster

Module 23: Patterns for information relationships

539

Benefits and Uses Case
Encourages content discovery. Users can find relevant content they might not have searched for explicitly
Example: In Cluster, suggest related content clusters based on the topics and tags of a user's current
project
Increases user engagement. By providing relevant suggestions, users are more likely to spend more time
on the platform
Example: At the bottom of a content piece in Cluster, show related articles or resources from the same
or related clusters
Supports learning and research. Related content can help users explore a topic more deeply or from
different angles
Example: When a user is viewing an AI-generated summary in Cluster, suggest other content pieces
that cover related subtopics or offer different perspectives
Improves content organization. By linking related content, you create a more interconnected and coherent
information structure
Example: Use related content suggestions in Cluster to create thematic links between different
clusters, helping users see connections across their projects.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Curiosity Gap. Well-crafted related content suggestions can create a sense of curiosity, encouraging
users to explore further
Example: In Cluster, use intriguing titles or brief teasers for related content suggestions to spark user
interest
Cognitive Momentum. Once users start exploring a topic, they're more likely to continue if presented with
relevant, interesting options
Example: As users navigate through related content in Cluster, dynamically update suggestions based
on their browsing path to maintain relevance and encourage continued exploration
Implicit Learning. Users can gain a broader understanding of a topic by being exposed to related content,
even if they don't explicitly seek it out
Example: In Cluster's content viewing interface, subtly highlight key terms that appear across related
content pieces, helping users implicitly grasp important concepts or trends in their field.

Module 24: Patterns for wayfinding and navigation

542

Wayfinding
Wayfinding and navigation are crucial aspects of user interface design that help users understand where they
are within an application, how to get to where they want to go, and what actions they can take. Effective
navigation patterns can significantly improve user experience, reduce confusion, and increase overall
efficiency and satisfaction with a product.
In this module, we'll explore various patterns for implementing wayfinding and navigation in your designs, with
a focus on how these can be applied to our Cluster project. We'll cover the following patterns
Priority and progressive disclosur
Off-canvas navigatio
Sticky vs. fixed navigatio
Bottom navigation
Each of these patterns offers unique strategies to help users navigate through complex interfaces and find
the information or features they need quickly and intuitively. By implementing these patterns effectively, you
can enhance the usability and user satisfaction of your application, making it easier for users to accomplish
their goals.
As we explore each pattern, we'll use examples from Cluster to demonstrate how these navigation techniques
can be implemented in a real-world scenario, enhancing the user's ability to navigate and understand the
complex web of content and features within the platform.

Module 24: Patterns for wayfinding and navigation

543

Types of navigation
Before diving into specific navigation patterns, it's important to understand the different types of navigation
groups commonly used in interface design. These groups help organize navigation elements based on their
purpose and relevance to the user's tasks.

Navigation Group
Product or Entity Navigatio
The primary navigation system that allows users to access the main features and content areas of the
product
Used for
Mainline feature
Product entry point
Example in Cluster: The main navigation bar containing links to “Dashboard”, “Projects”, “Content
Library”, and “Analytics”
Contextual Navigatio
Navigation elements that change based on the user’s current context, task, or location within the
product
Used for
Shortcut
Recently visited page
Related or sub page
Custom bookmarks or saved item
Example in Cluster: A sidebar within a project view showing recently edited content, related clusters,
and user-created bookmarks
System Navigatio
Navigation for accessing user-specific or application-wide settings and administrative functions.
Used for
Accoun
Billin
User permission
Setting
Example in Cluster: A dropdown menu accessible from the user's profile icon, containing links to
"Account Settings," "Billing," "Team Management," and "App Settings."

Module 24: Patterns for wayfinding and navigation

545

Understanding these navigation groups helps designers create intuitive and organized navigation systems
that cater to different user needs and tasks.
As we explore specific navigation patterns in the following sections, we'll consider how they can be applied to
these different navigation groups within the context of Cluster and similar applications.
Now, let's move on to our first specific navigation pattern: Priority and progressive disclosure.

Module 24: Patterns for wayfinding and navigation

546

Priority and progressive navigation
Priority and progressive disclosure in navigation is a technique that organizes and reveals navigation options
based on their importance and relevance to the user's current context. This approach helps manage complex
navigation structures by showing the most important or frequently used items upfront, while keeping less
common options accessible but initially hidden.

Reference

Example of using visual hierarchy and placement to prioritize the most important or frequently used navigation items

Module 24: Patterns for wayfinding and navigation

547

Benefits and Uses Case
Reduces cognitive load. By presenting fewer options initially, users aren't overwhelmed with choices
Example: In Cluster's main navigation, show top-level categories like "Projects" and "Analytics," with
subcategories revealed on hover or click
Improves usability for new users. Essential functions are immediately visible, while advanced features are
discoverable as users become more familiar with the system
Example: Display basic content creation options prominently in Cluster, with advanced AI-powered
features accessible through a "More" dropdown
Enhances efficiency for power users. Frequently used items are easily accessible, while less common
actions are available when needed
Example: In Cluster's content editor, show common formatting options upfront, with advanced layout
and styling tools in an expandable panel
Adapts to different screen sizes. This approach supports responsive design by allowing complex
navigation to be condensed on smaller screens
Example: On mobile devices, collapse Cluster's full navigation into a hamburger menu, with primary
actions still visible as bottom navigation icons.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Hick's Law. Reducing the number of initial choices decreases decision time and cognitive load
Example: In Cluster's dashboard, present the most used project types upfront, with a "More" option to
access less frequently used templates
Progressive Disclosure. Revealing information gradually helps users build a mental model of the system
without being overwhelmed
Example: When creating a new content piece in Cluster, start with basic options, then offer advanced
settings like AI-assisted writing as the user progresses
Recognition over Recall. Visible navigation options support recognition memory, reducing the need for
users to remember where features are located
Example: Use clear, descriptive labels and icons in Cluster's navigation to help users quickly recognize
and find the features they need.

Off-canvas navigation
Off-canvas navigation is a design pattern where the main navigation menu is initially hidden off-screen and
can be revealed by a user action, typically by clicking a menu icon or swiping from the edge of the screen.
This pattern is particularly useful for mobile interfaces or desktop applications where screen real estate is at a
premium.

Module 24: Patterns for wayfinding and navigation

551

Benefits and Uses Case
Maximizes screen space. By hiding the navigation off-screen, more space is available for content
Example: In Cluster's mobile interface, use an off-canvas menu to house the full navigation, leaving
more room for content display in the main view
Provides comprehensive navigation. Off-canvas menus can accommodate longer lists of navigation items
without cluttering the main interface
Example: Include all of Cluster's features and tools in an off-canvas menu, organized into categories
like "Content Creation," "Collaboration," and "Analytics.
Supports responsive design. This pattern works well across different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop
Example: On larger screens, Cluster could use a visible sidebar for navigation, which transforms into an
off-canvas menu on smaller screens
Offers contextual options. Off-canvas areas can be used for more than just navigation, providing space for
contextual tools or information
Example: In Cluster's content editor, use an off-canvas panel to display formatting options, revision
history, or collaboration tools.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Out of Sight, Out of Mind. Hiding complex navigation reduces cognitive load when users are focused on
main tasks
Example: When users are engaged in content creation in Cluster, the hidden navigation reduces
distractions and allows focus on the task at hand
Progressive Disclosure. Off-canvas navigation reveals options progressively, helping users manage
complexity
Example: In Cluster's off-canvas menu, use expandable sections to further organize navigation items,
revealing sub-items only when a main category is selected
Spatial Memory. The consistent location of the off-canvas menu helps users build spatial memory of
where to find navigation options
Example: Always slide out Cluster's off-canvas menu from the left side of the screen to build user
familiarity and expectation.

Sticky vs. fixed navigation
Sticky and fixed navigation are techniques used to keep important navigation elements visible as users scroll
through content. While similar, they have distinct characteristics: sticky elements remain in place until a certain
scroll point is reached, then move off-screen, while fixed elements stay in the same position regardless of
scrolling.

Module 24: Patterns for wayfinding and navigation

555

Benefits and Uses Case
Improves accessibility. Key navigation options remain easily accessible, regardless of the user's position
on the page
Example: In Cluster, use a sticky top bar with quick access to "Create New," "Search," and
"Notifications" functions
Enhances user orientation. Persistent navigation helps users maintain context within the application
Example: Implement a sticky sidebar in Cluster's project view, showing the current project structure as
users scroll through long content
Increases efficiency. Users can navigate to different sections without scrolling back to the top
Example: Use a fixed bottom bar in Cluster's mobile interface for essential actions like "Save," "Share,"
and "Edit.
Supports complex interfaces. For applications with many features, sticky or fixed elements can provide
constant access to important tools
Example: In Cluster's content editor, use a fixed top bar for formatting options and a sticky side panel
for content structure navigation.

Psychological Principles Supporte
Perceived Stability. Consistent navigation creates a sense of stability in the interface, reducing cognitive
load
Example: Keep Cluster's main navigation bar sticky at the top of the page, providing a stable reference
point as users scroll through content
Immediacy. Quick access to navigation supports the principle of immediate action, enhancing user
efficiency
Example: Use a fixed floating action button in Cluster for quick content creation, always accessible
regardless of scroll position
Spatial Constancy. Fixed elements support users' spatial memory, allowing them to build muscle memory
for frequently used actions
Example: Maintain a consistent location for Cluster's search function in a sticky header, allowing users
to quickly access it without thinking.

Module 24: Patterns for wayfinding and navigation

559

Benefits and Uses Case
Improves one-handed usage. Placing navigation at the bottom of the screen makes it easier to reach with
thumbs on larger mobile devices
Example: In Cluster's mobile app, use bottom navigation for primary actions like "Home," "Projects,"
"Create," and "Notifications.
Enhances visibility of key features. Bottom navigation keeps important actions constantly visible and
accessible
Example: Include a "Quick Add" button in the center of Cluster's bottom navigation for rapid content
creation
Supports task switching. Users can easily switch between main sections of the app without reaching to
the top of the screen
Example: Allow Cluster users to quickly toggle between "My Work," "Team," and "Analytics" views via
bottom navigation
Provides clear navigation structure. Bottom navigation clearly communicates the main sections or
features of the app
Example: Use distinct icons and labels in Cluster's bottom navigation to represent different content
types like "Articles," "Images," and "Videos."

Psychological Principles Supporte
Fitts's Law. Bottom navigation minimizes the distance and effort required to reach key functions, especially
on mobile devices
Example: Place Cluster's most frequently used features in the bottom navigation, reducing the time
and effort needed to access them
Recognition over Recall. Icons and labels in bottom navigation help users quickly recognize and access
main features without having to remember their location
Example: Use clear, universally recognized icons in Cluster's bottom navigation, such as a house for
"Home" or a bell for "Notifications.
Chunking. Bottom navigation naturally chunks the main sections of the app, making it easier for users to
understand and remember the app's structure
Example: Group Cluster's features into 3-5 main categories in the bottom navigation, helping users
mentally organize the app's functionality.

THE CEILING OF DESIGN PATTERNS
As we reach the end of our journey together, let's talk about something important: the evolution and limitations
of design patterns.
Throughout this book, we've explored numerous patterns and rules for designing at warp-speed. These
patterns have served us well - they've helped us make faster decisions, create more consistent interfaces,
and deliver better user experiences. But there's an interesting tension we need to address.

The Great Pattern Debate
In the design community, there's an ongoing debate about the standardization of interfaces. You might have
noticed it yourself - many websites and applications are starting to look increasingly similar. This has sparked
two distinct schools of thought:
The first group champions standardization. They argue that by making "good design" easier to produce at
scale through UI kits, accessibility principles, design systems, and established patterns, we raise the floor of
what's considered acceptable design. This democratization of design means more people can create usable
products, even without extensive design resources or expertise. The result? More problems get solved for
more people, and in turn, reduces more suffering in the world.
The second group advocates for innovation and creativity. They push us to break rules, challenge
conventions, and explore new possibilities. They argue that while patterns are useful, too much reliance on
them can lead to stagnation. By pushing boundaries, this group helps elevate the ceiling of what's possible in
design.
Here's the truth: we need both approaches.

The Pattern Lifecycle
Think about how new patterns emerge. Every revolutionary interface pattern we now take for granted - from
hamburger menus to pull-to-refresh - started as someone's experiment. Someone looked at an existing
problem and thought, "There must be a better way."
Sometimes these experiments fail. But sometimes they succeed spectacularly, becoming so effective that
they're widely adopted and eventually become standard patterns themselves. This is the natural lifecycle of
innovation in our field.

Systems Thinkers and Innovators
This brings us to an important distinction in our field: systems thinkers versus innovators.
Systems thinkers excel at understanding patterns, creating scalable solutions, and implementing consistent
design languages. They're the architects who build the foundations that allow teams to work efficiently and
products to scale effectively.
Innovators, on the other hand, excel at questioning assumptions and exploring new possibilities. They're the
pioneers who push boundaries and discover new patterns that eventually become tomorrow's standards.
Both roles are crucial. Systems thinkers help us build reliable, scalable products efficiently. Innovators help us
break through plateaus and discover new ways of solving problems.

Finding the Balance
The key is knowing when to leverage existing patterns and when to innovate. This brings us full circle to our
discussion of warp-speed design.
When time is short and risks are low, existing patterns are your friends. They're battle-tested, user-familiar, and
efficient to implement. But when you identify an opportunity to meaningfully improve the user experience and you have the clarity and resources to explore it - that's when innovation becomes valuable.
As we stand at the cusp of new computing paradigms - spatial computing, AI interfaces, ambient computing our existing patterns will be challenged. Some will adapt and evolve. Others will be replaced entirely by new
patterns better suited to these new modalities.
This is why understanding both the value and limitations of patterns is crucial. The patterns we've discussed in
this book aren't meant to be rigid rules, but rather tools in your toolkit. They give you a solid foundation to work
from, whether you're operating at warp-speed or taking time to innovate.

The evolution of creating software products
Let me take you back to the early 2000s.
When I first started mass-producing software, we inherited a specific set of principles from those who came
before us: User-Centered Design, lean manufacturing adaptations, interaction design based on older
technology, the transition from waterfall to agile, WCAG 1.0, and hard lessons from the dot-com boom.
Since then? We've had to adapt. Constantly.
Think about everything that's reshaped our industry: Web 2.0, cloud computing, smartphones, lean startup
methodology, social media, the rise of the product-design-engineering tripod model, new design tools, design
systems, massive venture capital injections, and most recently, remote collaboration.
And guess what? The frontier ahead is just as riddled with new innovations.

The Pendulum Swing
Here's something I've noticed: our industry moves like a pendulum. We swing from one extreme to another,
then back to center, then off again in a new direction.
Remember "move fast and break things"? That pendulum swung away for valid reasons. But that mentality is
becoming extremely relevant again, especially in the context of skill development.
The key is not to get frustrated by these swings. We must adapt.

The Future of Software Production
I'm seeing some interesting trends that point to where we're headed:

AI is reshaping roles. Companies like Netflix are offering astronomical salaries for AI-focused positions.
This isn't just hype - it's a fundamental shift in how we'll create software
The rise of the generalist-specialist. "Design Engineers" are becoming more common. Companies want
designers who can code, strategize, and think about business impact
Hybrid roles are emerging. Traditional job titles are evolving. We're seeing positions like "Product
Activation Lead" that wouldn't have existed a few years ago.
And here's what's in demand:
Senior ICs capable of high-quality, rapid executio
Hands-on design managers leading small team
Those who can navigate between craft and business impact

The Industrialization of Software Design
Here's a truth that might ruffle some feathers: The floor of quality across the board has substantially increased
for anyone starting the process of producing software. This is the value of the ongoing industrialization of
software design.
Yes, not every company is leveraging design thoughtfully or achieving their ceiling. But the tools, patterns, and
knowledge we've accumulated have made it easier than ever to create decent software products.
Some see this as a problem. They bemoan technical and economic evolution. But they're missing the bigger
picture: mass producing software creates more abundance. And creating more abundance in the world is one
of the best ways to reduce conflict, warts and all.

The Future is Tooling (But Not Just Tooling)
Here's something I've noticed: our industry moves like a pendulum. We swing from one extreme to another,
then back to center, then off again in a new direction.
Remember "move fast and break things"? That pendulum swung away for valid reasons. But that mentality is
becoming extremely relevant again, especially in the context of skill development.
The key is not to get frustrated by these swings. We must adapt.

Future-Proofing Your Career
If you’re interested in staying ahead of the curve, focus on:

Playing with new design material (spatial computing, AI, emerging tools
Investing in targeted learning through courses and hands-on experienc
Learning net new skills, especially in your business blindspot
Blocking out doomsdayers and cynical noise
Remember: Some companies value craft to an inspiring degree. But it's important to note that many of those
companies we look up to could only value craft after they became profitable.
When thinking about craft, consider that in most cases, we are in service of crafting businesses, not just
software.

The Road Ahead
The opportunities ahead are enormous for designers who know how to:
Hone their tast
Ship to customer
Leverage distribution
It's never been easier to be a multi-disciplinary designer. Gone are the days of limiting mastery to a single
vertical.
Stay curious. Stay adaptable. Keep building.
The future will be glorious for those who do.

Thank you
When I first wrote my book "Making Design Decisions," I was mostly sharing what I wished someone had
taught me earlier in my career. The practical stuff, the real-world scenarios, the tough trade-offs that few
people were talking about.
Your support of this work means more to me than you might realize.
Throughout my career, I've been fortunate to learn from some fantastic product builders. But sharing these
lessons with you, helping you navigate the complexities of modern software design - that's been one of my
most rewarding experiences.
I believe strongly that increasing abundance in the world is one of the best ways to reduce suffering, and that
technological progress is how we create sustainable economic growth. That's why I left my role as a design
lead to educate people on how to build better products, specifically in highly competitive markets.
My philosophy about product design isn't rooted in zealous debates about UX vs. UI or telling people how they
should build their careers. It's simpler than that: I want to help you learn to design cool shit in conditions that
suck, which happen to be more often than not.
Thank you for trusting me with your time and attention. Thank you for being willing to challenge some
conventional wisdom and explore new ways of working. Thank you for being part of this journey.
You've got this. The skills you've learned here aren't just about designing faster - they're about designing with
intention, with strategy, with purpose. Use them well.
You've got this. The skills you've learned here aren't just about designing faster - they're about designing with
