# Session 010: Project Progress and Path to v1 Release

## Date: March 18, 2025

## Overview
Today marked a pivotal shift in our project's direction. While we hit some roadblocks with browser tools, we made breakthrough progress in authentication and database integration. We're now 15 days away from Version 1, with a clear path forward.

## Achievements

### 🔧 Development Tools
- Attempted Chrome extension setup (paused after 2.5h troubleshooting)
- Shifted focus to core functionality
- Documented lessons learned for future attempts

### 🔐 Authentication & Database
- Connected Clerk with Supabase successfully
- Set up proper user roles and permissions
- Synced user profiles between systems
- Implemented role-based inventory access

### 🎨 UI Improvements
- Fixed brand card interactions
- Made inventory sheet scrollable
- Added working color tabs
- Solved card expansion issues
- Improved dashboard filtering

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Browser Tools Integration
**Problem**: Chrome extension setup blocking progress
**Solution**: Pivoted to core functionality instead
**Learning**: Know when to change course - core features first

### 2. UI Consistency
**Problem**: Random UI changes during debugging
**Solution**: Started component documentation initiative
**Learning**: Document UI behavior before building

### 3. Auth Edge Cases
**Problem**: Multiple clicks needed for auth
**Solution**: Improved session handling
**Learning**: Test edge cases early in development
