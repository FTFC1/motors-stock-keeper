### 11:15 - Fixed Critical Bug in View Inventory Sheet

We've addressed a critical bug in the View Inventory sheet where duplicate color tabs were being created when adding units with an existing color:

1. **Issue Identification**:
   - When adding new units with a color that already existed (e.g., "SILVER"), a duplicate color tab was created instead of updating the existing tab.
   - The bug occurred because color matching was case-sensitive, so "SILVER" and "Silver" were treated as different colors.
   - This caused confusion in the UI and made inventory tracking difficult.

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - In the `InventorySheet` component, color grouping was performed without normalizing the color names.
   - The color grouping logic was using direct string equality without case normalization.
   - This allowed multiple variants of the same color (e.g., "SILVER", "Silver", "silver") to create separate tabs.

3. **Solution Implemented**:
   - Modified the color grouping logic in `InventorySheet.tsx` to normalize colors for comparison.
   - Implemented case-insensitive matching using uppercase normalization.
   - Added logic to detect existing color keys that match the normalized version of a new color.
   - Ensured the original display format of colors is preserved for UI display.

4. **Benefits**:
   - Units with the same color but different case formatting now appear under a single tab.
   - Inventory counts are accurate since all units of the same color are grouped together.
   - UI is cleaner with no duplicate color tabs.
   - User experience is improved with more predictable behavior when adding units.

This fix ensures that the "Add Units" feature behaves correctly by updating the count of existing color tabs rather than creating duplicates, making the inventory management system more reliable and user-friendly.

### 12:30 - Enhanced "Add Units" Experience in View Inventory

We've made significant improvements to the "Add Units" experience in the View Inventory sheet:

1. **Preserved Context When Adding Units**:
   - Modified the InventorySheet component to keep the sheet open when clicking "Add More"
   - Added an inline dialog that appears on top of the View Inventory sheet
   - Ensured users don't lose context of which vehicle they're viewing when adding units

2. **Clear Vehicle Identification**:
   - Added vehicle details (brand, model, trim) to the "Add New Units" dialog header
   - Included the selected color in the dialog description
   - Provided visual context showing exactly which configuration is being modified

3. **Direct Color Pre-selection**:
   - Pre-filled the color field when adding units from a specific color tab
   - Maintained ability to select different colors if needed
   - Improved user experience by reducing redundant input

4. **Streamlined Workflow**:
   - Eliminated unnecessary navigation between sheets
   - Maintained state consistency throughout the operation
   - Added proper feedback when units are successfully added

These improvements make the inventory management workflow more intuitive and efficient, reducing the chance of errors and providing users with better context when performing operations.

### 13:15 - Improved Multi-Unit Addition Workflow

We've made further improvements to the "Add Units" experience based on user feedback:

1. **Persistent Inventory View**:
   - Modified the Add Units dialog to remain on top of the inventory sheet without dismissing it
   - Added conditional rendering to ensure dialogs only appear when the inventory sheet is open
   - Improved the state management to prevent accidental sheet dismissal

2. **Streamlined Multiple Additions**:
   - Enhanced the form to reset after submission rather than closing
   - Maintained context after adding units, allowing multiple additions without re-navigation
   - Added form state reset that preserves the current color selection when appropriate

3. **Color Awareness and Suggestions**:
   - Added an "existingColors" system that prioritizes showing colors already in use for the vehicle
   - Added passing of vehicle's actual existing colors to the ColorCombobox
   - Improved color suggestions to include what's already in the inventory

4. **Error Handling and Feedback**:
   - Added reset logic to provide clear feedback after successful addition
   - Improved cancel behavior with explicit control flow
   - Enhanced the visual appearance with proper spacing and layout

These changes significantly improve the user experience when adding multiple units of different colors to the inventory. Users can now efficiently add several different color variations without having to repeatedly navigate back to the inventory sheet, saving time and reducing the chance of errors.

## Progress (14 May 2024)

### Fixed Duplicate Color Tabs in 'View Inventory' Sheet
- Identified the root cause of duplicate color tabs in the inventory sheet
- Implemented case-insensitive color name normalization to prevent duplicates
- Modified the `handleAddUnits` function to use normalized color names
- Updated the `InventorySheet` component to group units by normalized colors

### Enhanced "Add Units" Functionality
- Fixed issue with the color combo box not displaying existing colors
- Enhanced the ColorCombobox to handle existing colors with improved display
- Added direct color pre-selection when adding more units of an existing color
- Implemented better messaging when no colors are found for a specific trim
- Added the ability to add new colors when none are found in the database

### Fixed Inventory Sheet Dismissal Issue
- Fixed critical UX issue where the inventory sheet was dismissing when adding new units
- Modified the `InventorySheet` component to keep the sheet open when adding units
- Updated the dialog flow in `GroupedVehicleCard` to prevent premature closing
- Added visual feedback via toast notifications when units are successfully added
- Improved overall workflow efficiency by allowing multiple sequential additions

### Simplified Inventory Sheet Behavior (15 May 2024)
- Fixed persistent issue with inventory sheet dismissal
- Simplified the Sheet component's behavior to only dismiss when explicitly clicked away
- Removed all automatic dismissal behavior for all operations (editing, adding, batch editing)
- Ensured modals (like Add Units, Edit Unit) never interfere with the inventory sheet's visibility
- Created a much more predictable user experience with explicit dismissal only

These improvements ensure a more streamlined inventory management experience, particularly when adding multiple units of the same model but with different colors or statuses. The inventory sheet now remains open at all times until the user explicitly closes it. 

## Final Fix for Inventory Sheet Persistence (15 May 2024)

After further testing, we identified and fixed a critical issue where the inventory sheet was still dismissing after adding new units:

1. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Identified complex interactions between state updates causing sheet dismissal
   - Sheet component was unmounting during operations despite our previous fixes
   - Form submission was triggering unexpected React re-renders

2. **Comprehensive Solution**:
   - Implemented robust internal state management to guarantee sheet visibility
   - Added defensive code to prevent any accidental sheet dismissal
   - Modified form submission behavior to maintain context during operations
   - Created a resilient architecture that respects user intent for sheet visibility

3. **Key Technical Improvements**:
   - Added internal `sheetOpen` state to track sheet visibility independently
   - Ensured all operations explicitly set `sheetOpen` to true 
   - Modified all user interactions to prevent dismissing the sheet accidentally
   - Fixed dialog and sheet components to respect each other's state

4. **User Experience Benefits**:
   - Inventory sheet now reliably stays open during all operations
   - Full workflow context is maintained when adding multiple units
   - Users can perform unlimited operations without losing inventory context
   - Sheet only closes when explicitly requested by clicking away

This final fix creates a seamless inventory management experience allowing users to perform multiple operations in sequence without losing context or having to reopen sheets. 

## Tab Persistence in Inventory Sheet (15 May 2024)

Based on user feedback, we identified and fixed an issue where the inventory sheet would reset to the first color tab when adding units. This was disorienting for users who needed to add multiple batches of units for the same color.

### Improvements Made

1. **Tab State Preservation**: The inventory sheet now tracks the active color tab and maintains this selection when adding units.

2. **Context-Aware Operations**: When adding units of a specific color, the sheet automatically shows that color's tab after the operation completes.

3. **Seamless Experience**: Users can now add multiple batches of the same color without losing their place in the UI.

4. **Reduced UI Flashing**: Eliminated the closing/reopening behavior that was causing the UI to reset between operations.

These improvements make the inventory management workflow much more intuitive, especially when working with multiple colors of the same vehicle model. 

## Final Optimisation for InventorySheet Component (15 May 2024)

### Challenge
After previous fixes for keeping the inventory sheet open, users reported a subtle UX issue: the sheet was correctly maintaining the active color tab, but was still reopening (remounting) when adding units, causing a jarring flash/reload effect.

### Solution
We implemented a comprehensive optimisation to ensure the inventory sheet stays fully mounted and only updates its contents without remounting:

1. **Memoized Components**: Used `React.memo` and component memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders and remounts of the inventory sheet and its contents.

2. **Persistent Sheet Tracking**: Added a `persistentOpenSheetsRef` to track which sheets should stay mounted regardless of state changes.

3. **Stable Props References**: Implemented `useMemo` for props passed to the `InventorySheet` to ensure stable references and prevent unnecessary re-renders.

4. **SmartVisibility Logic**: Modified the visibility logic to control the display without triggering remounts.

5. **Optimised Tab Content**: Created a dedicated `MemoizedTabContent` component to efficiently handle tab content updates without redrawing the entire sheet.

### Technical Implementation
- Used `React.memo` to prevent costly re-renders
- Implemented proper TypeScript interfaces for all components
- Added refs to track sheet state without triggering re-renders
- Carefully managed DOM updates to prevent flashing/flickering

### User Experience Benefits
- **Seamless Content Updates**: The inventory sheet now updates its content without any visible remounting or flashing.
- **Smoother Interactions**: Adding units, switching tabs, and updating data all happen without disrupting the user's context.
- **Improved Performance**: Reduced unnecessary re-renders and DOM operations for a more responsive interface.
- **Consistent Context**: Users maintain their place in the interface during all operations.

These optimisations represent best practices in React UI development, ensuring that state updates remain efficient while providing a smooth, non-disruptive user experience.
