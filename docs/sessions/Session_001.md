# Session 001 - Project Setup and Initial Development

Date: March 3, 2024
Updated: May 15, 2024

## Overview
This session focused on transitioning the Motors Stock Manager project from Lovable to Cursor development environment and implementing initial UI improvements.

## Project State Assessment
### Current Setup
- Project is based on a React + TypeScript + Vite template
- Using shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for styling
- Basic routing and authentication structure in place
- Mock data implementation for vehicle management

### Tech Stack
- Frontend Framework: React 18 with TypeScript
- Build Tool: Vite
- UI Components: shadcn/ui (based on Radix UI)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Routing: React Router
- State Management: React Query
- Form Handling: React Hook Form
- Validation: Zod

## Decisions Made
1. **Development Environment**
   - Decided to move from Lovable to Cursor due to edit credit limitations
   - Created and switched to `cursor_002` branch for development
   - Maintained existing project structure and dependencies

2. **UI Improvements**
   - Implemented collapsible sidebar for better space utilization
   - Added smooth transitions for sidebar state changes
   - Implemented tooltips for collapsed sidebar state
   - Maintained mobile responsiveness
   - Redesigned vehicle inventory cards with modern sheet-based approach

3. **Data Structure**
   - Implemented unit-based vehicle data structure
   - Enhanced vehicle counting logic
   - Improved status tracking and filtering

## Completed Tasks
1. **Branch Setup**
   - Successfully created and switched to `cursor_002` branch
   - Verified existing codebase functionality

2. **Sidebar Enhancement**
   - Added collapse/expand functionality
   - Implemented smooth transition animations
   - Added tooltips for collapsed state
   - Maintained mobile responsiveness
   - Successfully committed changes to GitHub (commit: 97122bc)

3. **Vehicle Inventory UI Redesign**
   - Created new `InventorySheet` component for better mobile and desktop experience
   - Implemented responsive design with bottom sheet on mobile and side sheet on desktop
   - Organized vehicle units by color with tabbed navigation
   - Grouped units by status with clear visual hierarchy
   - Enhanced `StatusBadge` component with improved design
   - Added proper spacing, transitions, and touch-friendly controls
   - Improved scalability for handling large numbers of vehicles

4. **Data Structure Improvements**
   - Updated Vehicle type to include unit-level data
   - Modified mock data generation to create proper unit data
   - Enhanced filtering and sorting logic
   - Improved status counting and display

## Next Steps
1. **Authentication**
   - Replace mock authentication with Supabase auth
   - Implement proper role-based access control

2. **Database Integration**
   - Set up Supabase client
   - Implement real-time data synchronization
   - Replace mock data with actual database operations

3. **Vehicle Management**
   - Implement bulk update functionality
   - Create vehicle management UI components
   - Add change log functionality

4. **UI/UX Refinements**
   - Add animations and transitions for smoother user experience
   - Implement skeleton loaders for data fetching states
   - Enhance mobile experience with gesture-based interactions

## Notes
- The project has a solid foundation with modern tooling and libraries
- Documentation is comprehensive and provides clear requirements
- Mobile responsiveness is a priority and is being maintained throughout development
- The new sheet-based approach significantly improves the UX for managing large inventories

## Questions/Concerns to Address
1. Supabase integration strategy
2. Testing strategy for new components
3. State management approach for larger application features
4. Performance optimization for large datasets
